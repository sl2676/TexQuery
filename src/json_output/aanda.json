                "content": "Multiple systems are a common outcome of the star formation process , detected especially in the early stages . The occurrence of binary systems is $100~AU []Tobin13, Takakuwa12, Rodriguez98. The separation of companions is therefore an important signature of the physics of star formation. It is not clear how much the multiplicity of stars hinders planet formation and evolution. Numerical simulations have shown that in a given binary system there are some regions of orbit where planets are unstable . Specifically, if the planet is orbiting one of the two stars, there is a maximum semi-major axis beyond which the planet's orbit is unstable; instead, if the planet is orbiting both stars, there is a minimum semi-major axis below which the planet is unstable.  Observations have shown that planets and protoplanetary disks easily form and survive around binary systems . It should also be noted that in a star-forming environment, binaries have the added complication that they present a larger cross section for encounters with other stars, and consequently the likelihood of interactions that could potentially destabilize the planetary system is higher than for systems orbiting a single star . Therefore, it is crucial to better understand the effect of stellar multiplicity on the circumstellar disk structure, as this has a direct impact on the process of planet formation. Ongoing improvements in observational techniques and hydrodynamical simulations have shed new light on our understanding of the evolution of isolated protoplanetary disks, such as the mechanisms responsible for mass accretion , or the existence of multiphase instabilities and dynamical phenomena that can enhance planet formation rates . The presence of companion stars can significantly influence the dynamics and evolution of protoplanetary disks . On the one hand, companion stars can exert gravitational forces on the disk, leading to perturbations in the dust and gas distribution and in the orbital dynamics. On the other hand, tidal forces from the companions can induce gas flows or create regions of increased gas density, affecting the overall mass distribution and accretion rates within the disk, or affect dust evolution processes such as grain growth and fragmentation. All of these aspects have implications for the subsequent evolution of the disk and the formation of planetary systems. In the last decade, several observations of the gas and dust of disks in multiple star systems have been carried out, detecting compact ($<$ 100~AU) disks []Rota22, Zagaria21, Zurlo21, Akeson19, Manara19, Cox17, Harris_2012. The results confirm that the size and properties of the disks depend on the presence of companions. More recently, studies by , and have shown that the evolution and lifetimes of disks around binary- or multiple- star systems differ from those of single stars. Nevertheless, the effects of stellar multiplicity on disk evolution are still poorly constrained: the available samples and the separation range do not allow for a complete picture of disk evolution. In this paper, we focus on the dust to better constrain its evolution in disks in multiple star systems. Specifically, we use the Survey of Orion Disks with ALMA (SODA , ~2022), which with an angular resolution of $explores a broader disk population of 873 Class II disks around low-mass stars in Orion A below -6$^-5$^''0.7$^''m, with a resolution of 2$^''. The photometric classification of sources is based on IR or mid-IR excess colours, with IMPS and IRAC data merged with the 2MASS point source catalogue to generate an eight-band photometric catalogue. Among the 298405 point sources identified in the Orion molecular clouds, 3479 sources have been classified as Class II objects (dusty YSOs), with a mid-IR emission above that expected for a reddened photosphere. slightly updated the sample, including about 10 new dusty sources. Using ALMA, the SODA survey observed all disks in these previous Spitzer catalogs located in Orion~A below -6$^(or 1.5~M$_1.1$^''5$^'', a sensitivity $K_S < 19~mag$, and covers an extended spatial region of $950~pc^2$ (or 18.3 deg$^2$). This allows us to construct the most complete catalogue of dusty YSOs in the Orion~A molecular cloud to date. Compared to 2MASS, the sensitivity of VISTA is 4-5 magnitudes better and its resolution is improved by a factor of about 3. Therefore, the VISION catalogue contains more sources in the same coverage area, resulting in an improved YSO classification and a better discrimination of background galaxies or extended nebulous IR emission from YSO candidates. In this way, VISION allows the assembly of the multiplicity sample, while SODA provides the corresponding millimeter data to characterize the structure and evolution of the dust in the circumstellar disk.\n\n",

                "content": "The VISION and SODA surveys discuss their catalogue completeness with reference to . The main factor to consider for the completeness of the Spitzer-selected sample is the confusion between the nebular background and the sources, which is estimated from the Route-Median Square Deviations (RMEDSQ) of the pixels surrounding each YSO candidate of the Infra-Red Array Camera (IRAC, ). This provides an estimate of the incompleteness due to the local mid-infrared (MIR) background emission, which varies spatially and increases with stellar density. Thus, is less sensitive to fainter (or low-mass) stars in regions with non-negligible background emission. This can lead to a bias in our observations: the lower the mass of the star, the fainter and less massive the disk, but with non-negligible dispersion []Ansdell16, Pascucci16. However, this completeness is greatly enhanced in regions where the background emission is faint and the stellar density is low, such as L1641 and L1647. In addition, the VISION survey achieves $0.7$^''1.1$^''m) aimed at observing visual multiple systems in Orion at separations between 100 and 1000~AU. Of the 201 protostars and 198 pre-main-sequence stars with disks observed by these authors, they found 29 candidate binary systems and 1 candidate triple system around protostars, and 27 candidate binary systems and 1 candidate triple system around pre-main-sequence stars. In the region of interest, i.e. Orion~A below -6$^is computed employing the KNN algorithm. This involves dividing the arbitrary number of neighbors by the area of the circle with a radius equal to the distance (in parsecs) between the central object and the farthest selected object. The resulting value provides an estimate of the expected number of YSOs within a given area surrounding the central target. Following , we select 10 neighbors, obtaining:\n_= R_10th^2.\nIn principle, this approach can cause problems along the edges of the entire sample region. For objects along the periphery, the i-th neighbor may not represent the true i-th companion, since elements outside the region may not be considered. As a result, the local density may be underestimated. However, our SODA sample is mainly located in L1641 and L1647 (with a FoV of $), while VISION, i.e., the catalogue we use to identify multiple systems, has a larger spatial footprint ($P(D|I)$ is the combined probability of detecting a source, whether it is a companion or an unassociated source, within a given research radius $d$. To derive these terms, we followed . The detection probability is modelled as a Poisson distribution\nP~(k) = k!,\nwhere $= _YSOd^2$, $d$ the search radius employed in the density calculation and $k=10$ is the number of expected YSOs within this radius. Therefore, the probability of detecting at least one unassociated source is \nP~(unassociated~YSO) = 1 - P(k=0) = 1 - e^_YSOd^2,\nthe overall probability of detecting an object, regardless of its state of association, is\nP~(D|I) = P(~C|I) + (1 - e^-_YSOd^2) (1 - P~(C|I)),\nand the probability for this object of being the secondary of a binary system depends only on separation and on the local surface density of YSOs\nP~(C|I) = e^-d^2.\nWe computed the probability of being a multiple system for all the possible multiples, including in our final catalogue only the ones that pass the threshold value of 0.9.\n\n\n",

                "content": "Our final catalogue counts 61 binary systems, 3 triple systems and 1 quadruple system, located in the regions L1641 and L1647 of Orion~A. Figure~shows the sample distribution of our binary systems in Orion~A color-coded according to the system mean dust mass, whereas Figure shows the distribution of the same sample color-coded according to the system separation. It appears that the lower mass binaries are mainly to the east of the filament, while the higher mass ones are to the west. On the other hand, systems with separations smaller than about 3~kAU are evenly distributed along the Orion~A filament, while those with the largest separations are mainly located in L1641-S and L1641-N. have demonstrated that L1641-S and L1641-N contain the most irradiated disks in Orion~A. Therefore, our separation distribution could be a result of the external FUV radiation: the presence of massive stars could influence the system formation process or its very early evolution.\n\nThe quadruple configuration is rarely observed in the other nearby SFRs. Figure~shows the only quadruple system in our analysis quadruple system, consisting of 4 young stars (ages $1000~AU) cannot be resolved in our sample and are usually classified as single objects. To solve this problem, our analyses include 7 new closer binaries, with separations between 100 and 1000~AU, resolved by . All of these sources are visible, but not always resolved, in the continuum ALMA images at 225~GHz. We estimate the disk masses based on their ALMA continuum using the same procedure presented in paper~I . We assume that the continuum millimeter flux is optically thin. Knowing the distance $d$ and the opacity $k_can be related to the mass of the dust emitting the radiation by the equation:\nM_dust= k_B_(T_dust,eff).\nFor opacity and dust effective temperature we consider the constant values of $k_and $T_dust,effOphiuchus and Lupus samples are considered as well. In Figure~, we have reproduced the same plot, considering the multiple sample in Lupus , Taurus , and the regions L1641 and L1647 in Orion~A. As a guide, we show the linear regression from - performed using the hierarchical Bayes model ~-  that also includes the $& ~~~$log$~Z & & & && [$mJy/au$] & ~[$mJy$] & && & & & & & ~~~~~~- & ~~& & & & & & & ~~& & & The plots are obtained using the package by , which allows the fitting and comparison of complex models and implements a Monte Carlo technique called Nested Sampling. Specifically for our case upper limits are treated as constraints on the parameter space. The UltraNest algorithm iteratively samples from a series of nested probability contours, gradually exploring the imposed parameter space. During each iteration, UltraNest calculates the marginal likelihood $Z$ of the sampled parameter values based on the data and the imposed constraints, allowing the posterior distribution to be effectively explored. It is then possible to determine the relative predictive power of different models using Bayes Factors ($BF$). The linear regression in Figure~yields $log~Z=-20.8310.101$, while the regression fit in Figure~yields $log~Z=-18.3330.109$. Therefore, $BF=exp(log~Z_2 - log~Z_1)~>~1$, confirming that the second model is substantially favored (see ~1998): we identify a threshold separation x$_edge~4~AU beyond which the previously observed positive correlation between pair millimeter flux and projected separation is lost. \n\nRecent theoretical models and simulations show that multiple systems are formed mainly through three channels: turbulent fragmentation of the molecular cloud []Kawasaki23, thermal fragmentation of strongly perturbed, rotating, and infalling core []Boss13, Boss14, and fragmentation of a gravitationally unstable circumstellar disk []Longarini23, Stamatellos09. The first two scenarios will lead to multiples that are initially separated by several hundred to about 1000~AU, while the last one leads to the formation of companions with separation of $2 in mass over two orders of magnitude in FUV field strength. However, we do not observe a significant mass - separation trend in the SODA sources alone, and the similarity of the cumulative disk mass distributions suggests that the FUV radiation does not dominate the results. The effect of FUV on the multiplicity properties of YSOs is itself not well studied, and we do not have the data to test this in more detail. In addition, the results of our analysis are inherently limited by the observed systems: the observational resolution allows us to observe only systems with large separations. A closer comparison between systems of the same age and separation to the Taurus and Lupus data is possible with ad hoc spectroscopic surveys or direct imaging. \n\n\n",

                "content": "The result presented in the previous section was obtained by considering three different SFRs. Therefore, the new trend observed could be due to environmental differences in different regions. To clarify this, in this section we compare the disk mass distributions of binaries in the 4 nearby SFRs Lupus, Taurus, Orion~A and Upper Scorpius. We follow other studies []Zurlo21, Testi22, vanTerwisga22, Grant21, Cazzoletti19in using the Kaplan-Meier estimator to infer the distribution of disk masses. This work uses the implementation of this estimator in the package . This non-parametric tool for assessing censored random variables, relying on the assumption that the censoring is unrelated to the variable of interest, is robust in describing these distributions and facilitates their comparison. Figure~shows the inferred cumulative mass distribution for the approximately same-age Lupus, Taurus, and Orion A (age$5-11~Myr). Looking at regions of similar and different ages allow us to address the dependence between the region's age and the evolution of the disks within it. \n\nThe cumulative trends in Figure~show a consistent disk evolution across the whole mass range for the younger regions. To quantify this similarity, we use the log-rank correlation test , which states that a significant difference between samples can only be detected when the p-value is $p 0.05$. Note that since only supports right censored data for this test, we subtract our data from a constant before running the test. For our comparison, we find a p-value $0.05$ for each pair combination, indicating that the cumulative distributions for Lupus, Taurus, and Orion~A are not statistically distinguishable. On the contrary, the log-rank test confirms that the distribution of Upper Scorpius is statistically different from the distributions observed in the younger SFRs: the disks in the older region have lower dust masses, confirming that dust evolution is even more advanced in this region. This result is consistent with what has already been observed: recent surveys prove that if disks are optically thin at millimeter wavelengths, they typically hold just a few Earth masses of dust available for potential planet formation within the first 1-3~Myr []Ansdell18, Andrews13, while in later stages the dust evolution proceeds even further, resulting in even lower median disk []Barenfeld16. Because of the striking similarities observed between the mass distributions in regions of similar age in Figure~, it is reasonable to consider the entire sample of multiple systems from these regions.\n\n\n",

In this section, we look at how stellar multiplicity affects the individual components of binary systems. Our multiple sample results in mainly binary systems. For each of these systems the primary disk is selected as the brightest: considering the J magnitude in VISION III -- or the H and K magnitudes if the J magnitude is not available -- the disk with the lowest magnitude is selected as the primary. Figure~shows the cumulative distributions of the primary, secondary, and single disk dust masses. As a comparison, Figure~shows the cumulative mass distributions for the binary systems as a whole, i.e. we refer to the unweighted average mass of the dust in the two disks, and the single disk systems. The latter comparison suggests that the most massive disks surround single stars, and that the derived distributions for binary and single systems are different. Although the two distributions are compatible within the 1~$~10$^2$~M$_~10$^2$~M$_~0.023, which suggests a (weak but significant) difference in the underlying distributions, and thus that the disk evolution depends on the presence of a companion and the resulting physical interactions with it. For Figure~, on the other hand, the log-rank test proves that only the primary and the single disks distributions are statistically distinguishable ($p ",
