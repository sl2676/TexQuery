                    "Our approach for simulating a Taurus-like star forming region is to use a physically and empirically motivated set of initial conditions, including binary systems. We then benchmark our model against the spatial-kinematic properties of the present day Taurus to ensure that the simulation reflects the observed dynamical state. With this model, we are able to extract encounters which we can convert into the protoplanetary disc radii evolution using analytic formulae fit to numerical experiments for truncating encounters. \n\nIn the remainder of this section, we detail this process. First, we discuss our method for generating physically motivated initial conditions, starting with a gas density distribution in Section~",

Without any additional tuning, this yields a dynamical model with excellent agreement to the observed structure in Taurus by the metrics of the pair separation distribution and separation-velocity correlation. This has allowed us, for the first time, to accurately assess the global frequency of encounters in the Taurus star forming region.\n\nIn this way we have shown that, like the bull that is its namesake, stars in the Taurus star forming region rarely settle for one close encounter. Instead, star-disc systems act as stellar matadors, often enduring several close approaches with a neighbouring star. The closest approach distances change stochastically over time as binaries are themselves perturbed by low velocity neighbours. High order multiples can also form and break up on time-scales much shorter than the lifetime of Taurus. As a result, strong encounters at the present day can occur in one of four ways. The most common are: during the evolution of a chaotic multiple system; when an eccentric binary is perturbed; or as a result of a close approach in a very long period eccentric binary. Random encounters between single stars are rare, with close encounters in Taurus being mostly mediated through a binary companion. These categories can be blurred, and in some sense to distinguish between binary and unbound encounters is a false dichotomy. Since binaries and nearby low velocity stars influence each other, ",
