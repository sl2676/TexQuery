Please don't submit papers in this format.\n'referee' -- single column, double spaced, larger text, bigger margins.

These are shown in tables~--. The command names are -- as far as possible -- the same as those used in other major astronomy journals.\n\nMany other mathematical symbols are also available, either built into or via additional packages. If you want to insert a specific symbol but don't know the command, we recommend using the Detexify website.\n\nSometimes font or coding limitations mean a symbol may not get smaller when used in sub- or superscripts, and will therefore be displayed at the wrong size. There is no need to worry about this as it will be corrected by the typesetter during production.\n\nTo produce bold symbols in mathematics, use '' for simple variables, and the 'bm' package for more complex symbols (see section~). Vectors are set in bold italic, using ''.\n\nFor matrices, use '' to produce a bold sans-serif font e.g. ; this works even outside maths mode, but not all symbols are available (e.g. Greek).
