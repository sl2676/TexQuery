This behaviour is consistent with expectations of realistic discs where gravitational instabilities are weaker in the inner warmer regions of the disc . For the next few orbits, there are no major changes to the morphology of the disc (middle and top right panels). After 12 orbits, the spiral arms are weaker (bottom left panel).

Eventually, an equilibrium state occurs where heating balances cooling represented by a consistent spiral structure.\n\nStellar irradiation changes the evolution and fate of a gravitationally unstable disc . For a lower mass gravitationally unstable disc, the equilibrium state is now determined by the irradiation of the star and by changes to the surface density of the disc. The star supplies a constant source of heat which dominates over other forms of heating, making the irradiated disc behave more like an isothermal simulation where disc evolution is instead driven by changes in surface density. Angular momentum transport by the spiral arms results in viscous spreading which reduces the surface density and stabilises the disc over time. The strongly gravitationally unstable phase is relatively short-lived (around 10 outer orbits, or 10,000 years). Weak gravitational instabilities can persist for longer. This makes observing the short gravitationally unstable phase difficult, at least in the absence of infall, consistent with the rarity of such discs in observations.\n\nfound stellar irradiation suppressed fragmentation even for discs around solar mass stars even with disc-to-star mass ratios of 1. In contrast, we find fragmentation remains a possible fate for more massive discs ($>,0.25M_is the mass infall rate from the environment. Thus while an irradiated disc cannot self-regulate by changing the sound speed, it may be possible to reach a steady state by fresh supply of mass . suggested that high mass, thick discs could transport sufficient angular momentum to avoid fragmentation so long as the mass infall remains below $_inc_s^3/G$, potentially leading to steady mass accretion from excitation of global spiral modes []1997Laughlin. Examining if self-regulation could occur with mass infall in irradiation-dominated discs would make for worthwhile follow-up.\n\n",

Planets forming via gravitational instability will be limited to only the most massive discs. Although gas fragmentation may be limited in lower mass discs by the weaker spiral structures, the dust could instead play a bigger role in forming planets in gravitationally unstable discs. Spiral arms are pressure maxima where dust can be trapped and grow to form planetesimals . The amplitude and number of spiral arms impact the dynamics of dust in the spiral arms. Dust becomes more excited in stronger spiral arms, or if they are more numerous . Hence, weaker spiral arms with irradiation could be favourable to planetesimal formation as the dust could be less excited and collapse into clumps more easily. If planet formation occurs in these discs through gravitational collapse of gas or dust, then it must happen very early during the Class 0/1 phase when discs are massive enough to be gravitationally unstable .\n\nThe weaker spiral arms could also impact the fate of any planet that does form. showed that thermodynamics strongly influences planet-disc interactions in gravitationally unstable discs. Weaker spiral arms driven by stellar irradiation could make it easier for a planet's spiral wakes to control the evolution of the disc by more easily suppressing the spirals due to gravitational instabilities. Thus, giant planets may have better survival odds than in $-cooled discs, the disc returns to being unstable as it cools back down until it reaches a steady state with spiral shocks. With stellar irradiation, changes in surface density determine the fate of the disc. Flybys and infall change how mass is distributed. Thus, with stellar irradiation, any interactions with the star-forming environment that change the surface density profile of the disc could permanently alter the disc's evolution. \n\n",
