(m)^!1/2!  P_b&& =58\n  (!_bs!)^!!3/2!!  (!10^6m!)^!1/2!!  (!R_!)^!3/2!!  (!M_!)^!-1/2!days,\nwhere $P_b$ is the initial binary orbital period.\nThus $P_bs.\n\nBound stars from binary break-ups have been invoked to explain the so-called repeated partial TDEs. \nSeveral candidate events have been found/claimed recently, including \nASASSN-14ko \n[]Payne2021ApJ,Payne2022ApJ,Payne2023ApJ,Huang2023ApJL, \neRASSt J045650.3–203750 \n[]Liu2023AA,Liu2024AA, \nAT2018fyk \n[]Wevers2023ApJL, \nRX J133157.6–324319.7 \n[]Hampel2022RAA,Malyali2023MNRAS, \nAT 2020vdq \n[]Somalwar2023arXivand AT 2022dbl \n[]Lin2024ApJL.  \nHowever, in many cases, this interpretation should be considered tentative.  \nSince $, or $/_b 1$.  \nEquation () gives the orbital period of the bound star immediately after the binary break-up. \nFurther orbital decay due to gravitational radiation can reduce the period as well as the pericenter distance of the bound star:\nDuring this decay, the orbit evolves according to\na(1-e)e^12/191+e(1+121e^2304)^870/2299.\nSo a reduction of the pericenter distance by a factor of a few would imply a reduction of the eccentricity to $0.2$. \nIt is not clear whether a TDE with such a low eccentricity would be similar to the standard high-eccentricity TDEs.\n\n\nOur finding that an appreciable fraction of binary-SMBH encounters lead to stellar collisions may have interesting implications.\n\nAs discussed in Section , gentle encounters ($_b1$) result in mild stellar collisions, and the merger remnants are ejected from the SMBH with small velocities. \nThese ejected merger remnants typically have rapid rotations (because of the off-centered collisions) and may contribute to the exotic stellar populations at the centers of galaxies.\n\nOn the other hand, for deep encounters, the merger remnants are likely bound to the SMBH, with semi-major axis and eccentricity given by (see Eq.~, assuming $m_1=m_2=m$)\n&& a_rem=_rem(m),&& 1-e_rem=a_rem=2^1/3_b(M)^2/31.\nThe orbital period is \n&& P_rem=_rem^!3/2!  (m)P_b&&= 10(!_rem!)^!!3/2!!  (!10^6m!)\n!  (!R_!)^!3/2!!  (!M_!)^!-1/2!years.\n(Note that $_rem.\nThus these merger remnants could also provide an explanation for the repeated partial TDEs, especially for smaller $M/m$ or/and low-mass stars.\nThere are similar difficulties in this scenario compared to the bound star scenario (see Section~). \nOne advantage of the merger remnant scenario is that because of dissipation in the merger process, the merger remnant stars likely have a very extended envelope. \nThis makes their partial disruptions more likely even without significant orbital decay due to gravitational radiation.\n\nAnother by-product of stellar collisions induced by binary-SMBH encounters is the mass loss.\nSome of this mass will accrete onto the SMBH, generating accretion luminosity/flare even without the TDE of the star. We plan to examine these hydrodynamical processes in future works.\n\n\n",
