Therefore, the initial population of close-in giant planets formed in situ is expected to consist of low-mass planets occupying a similar orbital range. Considering the high occurrence of low-mass planets, it is reasonable to assume that in situ-formed giant planets are often accompanied by low-mass planets on similar orbits. This assumption leads to dynamical evolution that has observable implications ",
                    ". Recent observations from space-based observatories and radial velocity follow-up measurements of known transiting hot Jupiters have led to the detection of new low-mass planetary companions to hot Jupiters. Examples of such systems include WASP-47 ",

They also suggest that nearby low-mass planetary companions to stars hosting hot Jupiters may be more common than previously thought. Furthermore, such companions could be below the detection limits of many past surveys.\n\nThe majority of systems mentioned above exhibit low-mass companions on inner orbits to hot Jupiters, which is expected in the theory ",
                    ". In this case, the nodal recession of the inner orbit is always faster, meaning that a secular resonance can never be established. Hence, such planets are expected to remain in unperturbed, coplanar orbits. However, if low-mass companions exhibit on exterior orbits, the initially slower nodal regression of the orbit will accelerate as the inner body gains mass and the star spins down. Once affected by secular resonances, the orbit may become unstable or acquire high mutual inclination, making observations of both interior and exterior planets extremely challenging as, in this case, a non-transiting planet might orbit at a low inclination relative to the line of sight and produce only weak radial-velocity variations. Observation of a system with a transiting low-mass planet orbiting close to the poles of a star with non-transiting hot Jupiter would be an important piece of the puzzle addressing the in situ formation of hot Jupiters.\n\n",

To validate the variability in TESS LCs, we extracted cuts of TESS full-frame images around TOI-2458 and analyzed the variations in its neighboring stars. We used the same detrending vectors for each star to remove systematics. While none of the stars exhibit similar variability to TOI-2458, we still hesitate to rule out that we observe residual variations caused by systematic effects, given the suspicious phase that appears to be roughly synced with the spacecraft orbit. The WASP photometry has been able to exclude any variability of TOI-2458 down to a limit of 0.6",

Hence, the null detection in the WASP photometry is likely due to the small photometric amplitude of the signal. \n\nWe investigated the robustness of the isolation of the stellar rotation signal by performing a series of injection and recovery experiments. We used the TESS Pixel Response Functions (PRFs) to inject sinusoidal signals modeled after the isolated signal, with a period of 7.5 days and an amplitude of 50 electrons/s, into the target pixel file (TPF) for TOI-2485 at six phases ($",

They determined a critical semimajor axis of low-mass planets beyond which secular resonant excitation of mutual inclination of both planets is guaranteed. Therefore, in the case of an almost circular orbit of a hot Jupiter, dynamical interactions during the early stages of planetary systems' lifetimes should highly increase the mutual inclinations for the specific range of the semimajor axis.
