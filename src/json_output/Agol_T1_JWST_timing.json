                "content": "During Cycles 1-3 of JWST, transits of all seven planets in the TRAPPIST-1 system have been observed in\nthe near-infrared with NIRISS-SOSS and NIRSPEC-BOTS , as well as four additional transits observed with MIRI F1500W during a phase-curve observation of the system .  In this\nnote we focus on touching-up the timing forecast for this system; hence,\nwe only utilize near-IR transits thanks to their higher precision. From July 2022 - December 2023, using JWST NIRISS\nor NIRSPEC, there have been three transits observed of planet b (NIRISS-SOSS, JWST GO-2589, PI: ; JWST GO-1981, PI: Stevenson/Lustig-Yaeger), \nfive of planet c (NIRISS-SOSS, JWST GO-2589, PI: Lim; NIRspec-BOTS, JWST GO-2420, PI: Rathcke), two of planet d (NIRSpec-BOTS, JWST GO-1201, PI: Lafreni`ere),\nfour of planet e (NIRSpec-BOTS, JWST GTO-1331, PI: Lewis), five of planet f (NIRISS-SOSS, JWST GO-1201, PI: Lafreni`ere),\ntwo of planet g (NIRSpec-BOTS, JWST GO-2589, PI: Lim), and two of planet h (NIRSpec-BOTS, JWST GO-1981, PI: Steveson/Lustig-Yaeger).\nFor the unpublished times of transit, the light curves were analyzed using standard pipelines with quadratic limb-darkened transit models . The first two transit times of planet b were published in , while the third was simultaneous with a transit of planet h, described below.  For planet c, NIRISS/SOSS light curves were produced using the code , and fitted using , following the same procedure as for each of the two visits. Planet c NIRSpec PRISM light curves were generated using the pipeline and fitted with the python package to provide best-fit transit timings and their uncertainties.\nFor planets d, f and g, the light curves were fitted with the same framework as in . For planet h (and one simultaneous transit of planet b) the transit timings were derived using the Eureka pipeline, which was run to produce the light curves, and then the code was used to fit the transits and provide the best fit timings and their uncertainties.  When timing uncertainties are two-sided, we used the greater of the uncertainties to provide a symmetric\nerror bar for utilizing a chi-square statistic.  When multiple timing analyses were carried out, we checked that the measured times were consistent across analyses, and we used the larger of the timing uncertainties for each transit to make our forecast conservative.\n\nThe measured times are for planet b: $9779.2104750.000025$, $9780.721345810.000025$, $10289.88494460.0000098$;\nplanet c: $9772.4203880.000012$, $9881.4015210.000032$,\n$10247.09395050.0000125$, $10249.5150960.000034$, \n$10256.78106610.0000185$; planet d: $9889.2644770.000024$,\n$9893.3139460.000060$;\nplanet e: $10118.4598360.000032$, $10124.5589690.000022$,     \n$10148.9562610.000043$, $10246.5392860.000030$;\nplanet f: $9881.0353360.000064$,\n$10111.1857530.000043$,\n$10120.3879700.000045$,\n$10129.5938680.000096$,\n$10148.0051530.000042$;\nplanet g:\n$9777.83535890.0000105$,\n$9926.0531780.000017$; and\nplanet h: $10139.749280850.0000809$ and\n$10289.887623920.000299$.

                "content": "We carried out a transit-timing analysis using the timing data published in\nas well as the 23 new JWST times listed above. \nThe code was used to compute the transit\ntimes and their derivatives with respect to the initial conditions,\nusing the same integrator, initial conditions, time step, and parameter set described in .  The computation\nis Newtonian and plane-parallel.  We\nminimized the chi-square of the fit using the package which implements a Levenberg-Marquardt optimization algorithm.\n\nWith the optimization completed, we integrated the model to July 2027\nto cover the end of JWST Cycle 5.  Using the Laplace approximation, we\npropagated the uncertainties using the covariance matrix of the\noptimum model parameters dotted with the Jacobian of the transit times\nwith respect to the initial model parameters, yielding the uncertainties on the forecast times.  Yet, these forecast uncertainties almost certainly underestimate the true uncertainty.\n\nNotably, some of the JWST transits were affected by flares, and they may also be impacted by instrumental and/or stellar variability noise.  Moreover, using the Laplace approximation may not fully represent the probability distribution.  To address these issues we did the following: 1).we successively dropped a single transit of the 23 new JWST times, and re-optimized the timing model using the remaining data; 2).we used each optimized model to forecast the dropped time and its uncertainty; 3).we computed the normalized residuals of these 23 JWST times with respect to the forecast time and uncertainty based on the remaining data.  We found that the cumulative distribution of the normalized residuals is consistent with a Gaussian distribution, but with the uncertainties inflated by a factor of 3.14.  Consequently, for our forecast times based on the entire dataset, we inflate the forecast uncertainties by a factor of 3.14; this approach is analogous to leave-one-out cross-validation.\nWe leave a more detailed\nanalysis, including a markov-chain monte carlo analysis with a more\nrobust likelihood function, to future work.\n\nFigure shows the resulting transit-timing variations\nas a function of time.  The deviation of the new timing solution relative to the best-fit timing solution\npresented in is shown with dashed lines in each panel.\nIn all cases the agreement is excellent through the end of 2019, while\nthe timing solutions diverge slightly over the next few years.  The\nmost extreme case of divergence is for planet h, which is already\narriving $minutes through July 2027.\n\nThe values of the forecast times can be found in the data behind the figure.\nA Jupyter notebook used to produce this code is available from the first author.  As a check on the forecast times, we compared with five unpublished transit times from July 2024 for planets b, d and e under JWST program GO-6456 (PI: Natalie Allen and NÃ©stor Espinoza), and all five lie within 1-$",
