ALMA was in an extended configuration at the time of observation, with a maximum baseline of 15.2 km resulting in an angular resolution of $2025$ milliarcseconds (mas). This corresponds to $3040$ km on Kalliope, which was at a distance of 3.173 AU from the Sun and 2.165 AU from the Earth at the time of observation and subtended $15The flux densities and relative positions of Kalliope and Linus were determined from the visibilities using the CASA package , with Kalliope and Linus modeled as a disk and delta function respectively. The flux densities retrieved in this way were compared against those found by treating both components as disks in ; by ``aperture photometry'' on the images (using to sum up flux density in the images); by the OMFIT and TVSTAT tasks in the AIPS software package (OMFIT is similar to ; TVSTAT is similar to ); and by summing the non-negative deconvolution model (CLEAN) components . Summing the CLEAN components produced noisy light curves inconsistent with other the methods, while aperture photometry and the two-disk approach overestimate the flux density of Linus compared to the three other methods. The greatest consistency between methods, and the lowest scatter between observations, was found by using and modeling the brightness distribution of Linus as a delta function. This is also the preferred method for flux density retrieval if Linus is unresolved (discussed below), because it most accurately matches the true brightness distribution of the objects and fits the visibilities rather than the images, which are derived quantities. The reported uncertainties on the flux densities of the two objects, as well as their relative positions, are the uncertainties on the fit parameters as derived from the fitting algorithm. \n\nThe flux densities and relative positions of Kalliope and Linus are presented in Table for each snapshot, along with details of the observations. The uncertainties on the flux densities reported in Table are the fit uncertainties only. In particular, the flux density scale uncertainty is not included in the uncertainties given in Table because it affects all observations equivalently, but is incorporated whenever rotationally-averaged values are reported. The disk-averaged brightness temperature of Kalliope $<T_b,K>$ is calculated assuming the flux density arises from the emitting area predicted by the SAGE shape model of for the midpoint time of each observation, and are corrected for the CMB emission blocked by the asteroid.

For the Ku-band observations, the on-source time consisted of 36 scans each of duration $192 minutes.  For the Ka-band observations, the on-source time consisted of 60 scans each of duration $160 minutes.  The calibrator J2331-1556 was used for calibration of complex gain as a function of time, and 3C 138 was used for delay, bandpass, polarization angle (data were taken in full polarization mode), and flux density scale calibration.  While 3C 138 is known to be variable , so not always appropriate for flux density scale calibration at the VLA, at the time it was thought it was stable and it was known that the other standard source near that right ascension (3C 48) was in the midst of a significant flare from OVRO monitoring .  Unfortunately, it was later learned that 3C 138 was also undergoing a flare at the time, and our observations were in the early days of that flare.  Therefore, we used the so-called ``Perley & Butler 2017'' or ``PB17'' scale for the flux density of 3C 138, but with an adjustment for that flare.  Internal VLA observations were used to derive the adjustments to the flux density of the source at Ku- and Ka-bands at the time of our observations, which were 7[h!]\nccccccccccBand & Freq & # & T$_midmas] & [deg] & [K] & [mJy] & [Ka & 33 GHz & 1 & 12-19 22:46:24 & 58$4 & 0.503$8 & & 2 & 12-19 23:26:57 & 58$3 & 0.550$5 & & 3 & 12-20 00:07:31 & 58$3 & 0.497$4 & & 4 & 12-20 00:50:03 & 58$3 & 0.496$4 & & 5 & 12-20 01:36:57 & 59$3 & 0.518$4 & & 6 & 12-20 02:24:02 & 59$3 & 0.471$5 Ku & 15 GHz & 1 & 12-18 23:38:58 & 124$5 & 0.151$208 & 293 & 157$0.005 & & & 3 & 12-19 01:01:32 & 123$5 & 0.156$208 & 173 & 148$0.005 & & & 5 & 12-19 02:24:07 & 127$5 & 0.150$250 & 36 & 141$0.005 & lower than the subobserver longitude, and the sub-observer and subsolar latitudes are 61$^respectively in all observations.\n$^b$Subscript $K$ refers to Kalliope. Values in the table do not include a 2For both bands, the raw data were calibrated with the VLA calibration pipeline to produce a calibrated Measurement Set (MS), which contains the visibilities for each target.  At that point, CASA was used to export the visibilities to a UVFITS file which could be read into the AIPS (Astronomical Image Processing System) software package .  All further reduction and analysis were done in AIPS, described briefly below.\n\nSimilar to the ALMA data, and for the same reasons, individual scans were grouped together in snapshots with duration $and its uncertainty are computed from the peak flux density and rms of background image regions using the Planck function.\n\nAt Ku-band the flux density from Linus is too faint to be detected in the time we observed.  As noted above, even at Ka-band, the flux density is too faint to be detected in the individual snapshots.  However, by shifting and co-adding all of the data together it can actually be detected.  We did this by first subtracting the emission from Kalliope from the visibilities in each snapshot (since the viewing geometry is changing for each snapshot), then adding all of the data back together, then adjusting the phase center of the visibilities to track Linus instead of Kalliope throughout the observation and imaging that resulting dataset.  Linus can clearly be seen in the resulting image, and the resulting flux density is given in Table .\n\nThe VLA calibration pipeline does not perform polarization calibration.  We performed this calibration ourselves for the Ka-band data (for the unresolved Ku-band data we expect no detectable polarized emission), in the standard way in AIPS, using J2331-1556 as the so-called ``D-term'' calibrator and 3C 138 as the absolute polarization angle calibrator (its flare did not affect its polarization angle in a significant way).  As for the ALMA data, polarization intensity images were formed for each snapshot.  Also as for the ALMA data, we see no polarized emission, to a one-sigma level of $5",

We explore the effect on our results of the assumed $_elec, the depth over which the amplitude of the diurnal temperature wave is reduced by $1/e$:\n\n_th= c_pwhere the surface bulk density $) of the surface material for its emission angle $and $is the total number of pixels across Kalliope, $N_obsis the number of free parameters in the model. The noise level $^i$ associated with the th image is the image rms described in Section . As in previous studies , we consider that every combination of ($) that satisfies \n\n_r^2 < _r,min^2 is an admissible solution, where $N_dataccounts for the fact that the actual resolution of the data is oversampled by the number of pixels per resolution element. The latter is equal to 65 for the ALMA dataset. In the results, we present the minimum-$^2$ model as the best-fit value. The reported 1$= 23 ALMA thermal images, we generated forward models with $=$ [5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 50, 75, 100, 116, 135, 156, 181, 210, 244, 283, 328, 381, 442, 512, 594, 690, 800], $_1$ between 0 and 60 with a step size of 1 and $_2$ of [2, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60] assuming a smooth surface. The motivation for and application of the two dielectric constant parameters $_1$ and $_2$ in the model are described in Section .\n\nWe run a series of robustness test aimed at exploring the sensitivity of the solution found by the global model fits to the quality of the data and to model assumptions. We use the results of these tests to guide our  global model fitting. \n\nOur first test explores the effect of the SNR of the data on the accuracy of the retrieved parameters. To investigate this, we generated a dataset of fake ALMA data images by taking model images for several choices of ($) and adding noise with realistic characteristics at different levels. In practice, the noise that was used was simply the Stokes Q and U images (since they contained no signal) scaled up or down by different amounts and added to the model images. The fake dataset was produced by one of the authors, and sent to another author who performed the retrieval using the thermophysical model without knowledge of which ($) choices had been made in generating the fake data. We attempted the retrieval of $from nine different sets of fake data with different ($) choices and SNR ranging from $50. In all cases, the retrieved $were within 1$10 to $controls both the normal emissivity of the surface $E(0)$ as well as how the emissivity varies with emission angle $E()/E(0)$. However, for asteroid (16) Psyche, showed that this assumption led to systematic high residual temperatures at the limb of the asteroid as imaged by ALMA, and the parameters controlling these two effects needed to be decoupled to match the data. This decoupling in effect parameterizes the role of surface roughness and particle scattering in controlling how the emission drops off with emission angle.\n\nWe explore what level of error is introduced by assuming that one value of dielectric constant controls both $E(0)$ and $E()/E(0)$ by producing model images where these parameters are decoupled, and retrieving them using a model where they are coupled. To do this, we again created a dataset of fake ALMA data images in which the value of dielectric constant $_1$ that controls $E(0)$ may be different from the value $_2$ that controls $E()/E(0)$. The model parameters that were used to generate the fake ALMA dataset were again selected by one of the authors and the fake dataset sent to another author who blindly attempted the retrieval assuming that $_1=_2$. \n\nWe find that, in general, we do not accurately retrieve the ground-truth solution when the underlying $_1$ is very different from $_2$ and retrievals are performed under the assumption that $_1=_2$. Because of this, we generate an additional set of forward models corresponding to the ALMA Kalliope dataset presented in this paper, allowing $_1$ to be different than $_2$. We then use the same procedure outlined in Section to derive the best-fit values of $, while the derived value of $parameter uncertainties whether $_1$ and $_2$ are coupled or decoupled. However, the solution with $_1$ = $_2$ ($and $_1=_2$ = 15$^+5_-0) higher $_r^2$ than that for in which $_1$ is decoupled from $_2$. We therefore adopt the latter as our nominal case, whose results are presented in Section .\n\nWe tested the robustness of the solution against the choice of the shape model, which describes the large-scale topography of Kalliope, in two ways. \n\nAs our first shape model test, we performed the TPM retrievals described in Section using a different shape model, specifically the MPCD-ADAM shape model of instead of their SAGE shape model. We find that, when forward models are produced over the same grid of thermal inertia and dielectric constant, the best-fit solution is sensitive to the choice of the shape model but not beyond the level of the uncertainties. The use of the MPCD-ADAM shape model provides retrieved parameter ranges of $tiu and $1. This solution overlaps from those we obtain with the SAGE shape model at the 1$higher than that obtained with the SAGE shape model. Consistently across thermophysical properties tested, we find that the residual images computed using model images based on the MPCD-ADAM shape model show a dark ring indicating oversubtraction of model flux at the edge of the asteroid due to a shape model that is too large at this orientation. The dark ring is not present when the SAGE model is used. In addition, the MPCD-ADAM shape model is not visually a good match to the ALMA observations. Motivated by this, we adopted the SAGE model as nominal shape model for our analysis.\n\nAs our second shape model test, we created a dataset of fake ALMA data images consisting of model images generated using the MPCD-ADAM shape model with added noise as described in Section , but retrieved the best-fit parameters using the model images generated with the SAGE shape model, following the blind test approach described previously. We find that we can retrieve the ground truth $level in all cases, but not $if the true $. When $_elec>>_thby re-running the global model with $_elec. This finding can be explained by the fact that the electrical skin depth is smaller than the diurnal thermal skin depth in both the nominal and test case. For a low thermal inertia surface, in which the $_th.\n\nIn the local model, we permit the values of $to vary across the surface of Kalliope, assuming that $= _1= _2$. The local model is described in detail in and only briefly summarized here. Differentiating between the effects of $locally requires resolving temperature as a function of time of day for each surface location. While all datasets presented here cover at least 75The local model is based on the concept of a “surface unit”, defined as the subset of facets of the shape model that fall within a given pixel of a single ALMA image. Thus, each ALMA image defines an associated set of surface units, with each unit then occupying different pixels in the ALMA images as the asteroid rotates. We post-process the model images generated for the global model to build thermal emission curves associated with each surface unit, describing how the thermal emission from that unit evolves as a function of time as the asteroid rotates and a facet moves across the plane of sky, and as a function of the local $. We repeat the same procedure to generate the data thermal-emission curves and evaluate the goodness of fit of the model thermal emission curves to the observed thermal emission curves using Eq. and . We display the observed and modelled emission, and corresponding surface properties as a function of asteroid-centric longitude and latitude using the Mollweide (equal-area, pseudocylindrical) cartographic map projection with the prime meridian (PM) at the center of the map. To take into account the correlation between nearby pixels that characterizes the ALMA images (each ALMA beam contains about 65 pixels for Kalliope), we bin the surface properties in longitude and latitude on a grid with elements of angular size 5$^5^(defined in Section ). If the distribution of emission angles within a telescope resolution element is known, then the polarization fraction can provide a second independent constraint on the dielectric constant. For the case of an asteroid, the surface is modeled as a collection of facets following a choice of shape model, and each facet may have surface roughness that produces a distribution of emission angles at smaller scales. \n\nWe model the expected polarization signal from a smooth surface at the resolution of the observations as follows. We calculate the fractional polarization as a function of emission angle for a given dielectric constant as $F()=[R_()-R_()]/[2E()]$ where the emissivity $E()=1-[R_()+R_()]/2$ and $R_()$ and $R_, $_1$ and $_2$, we find a best-fit solution of $, $_1$ = 15$^+2_-1for Kalliope at 1.3 mm, corresponding to a minimum $_r^2$ of 12. \nThe residual images (data-minus-model) are shown in Figure for the minimum $_r^2$ corresponding to $thermal inertia range of 25-440 overlaps with the thermal inertia range of 5-250 that was found for Kalliope based on mid-infrared Spitzer spectroscopy .\n\n[ht!]\nThe 9 and 20 mm data do not have sufficient spatial resolution to provide a strong independent constraint on $. Thus, we compute the thermophysical model for the geometry of the 9 and 20 mm observations using the 1.3-mm best-fit parameter of $0.02, 0.56$0.02 at 1.3, 9, and 20 mm respectively. If the emissivity were calculated relative to the model surface temperature without accounting for subsurface emission, the 1.3-mm emissivity would be 0.62$and $12). The best-fit thermal inertia varies across the surface from $600–800, although the uncertainties in high-$100), and no clear statistically-significant trends are seen. The dielectric constant $and -120$^). For each surface unit, the results in Figure are obtained by computing the median of the model solutions that satisfy Eq. . This solution is consistent within uncertainty to that obtained by assuming that the combination of $corresponding to the minimum $^2_r$ in a surface unit is the best-fit solution. We elect to show the local solution based on the median because the resulting thermal inertia map is smoother, so that the appearance of spatial variations that might be artifacts or are not statistically meaningful given the uncertainties is minimized. Both approaches yield the same map of dielectric constant, building confidence in the finding of a region of anomalously high dielectric constant.\n\n[ht!]\n",

The mean flux density ratio between Kalliope and Linus, $f_K/f_L$, is 25.7$4.7 for the 9 mm observations. \n\n[ht!]\nThese ratios are lower than the ratios of the projected surface areas of the two objects. Linus' size was found to be 28$1 km based on a 2021 mutual event campaign . This gives a primary to secondary diameter ratio of 5:1 and area ratio of 29:1 using an effective diameter of 150 km for Kalliope . found a relative near-infrared intensity of $2 km. However, updating the effective diameter from 166 km (corresponding to the shape model used in their calculation) to 150 km gives a diameter for Linus of 28.5 km, consistent with other results and thus also indicating that the near-infrared reflectivity is not substantially different between the objects.\n\nIncorporating the uncertainties on both the sizes and the measurements (and using the instantaneous projected areas from the SAGE shape model), we find that the flux density per unit area is lower for Kalliope than Linus by a factor of 0.87$0.13 at 9 mm. Either Linus is larger than 28$/F$_Linus100. \n\n[ht!]\nThus, while Linus' slower rotation rate does cause a warmer surface, the effect is not strong enough to explain the difference in flux densities between the objects in the 1.3 mm observations. We therefore conclude that the thermophysical or dielectric properties differ between the two targets. A loose anti-correlation has been observed between asteroid size and thermal inertia, which is attributed to the greater ability of large asteroids to generate and retain fine-grained regoliths . Though such a scenario may not apply for two objects that are reaggregated ejecta like Kalliope and Linus may be, this would suggest a higher thermal inertia for Linus and hence a lower daytime temperature, exacerbating the discrepancy with Kalliope rather than resolving it. \n\nMoreover, the difference between the two objects is even greater at 9 mm, and the observations at that wavelength were made when Kalliope's pole was facing the Sun; assuming alignment of Linus' spin and orbital poles , neither rotation rate nor thermal inertia differences can substantially change the relative brightness temperature between the objects. \n\nWe therefore propose that the difference between the two targets arises from a difference in emissivity. By applying the ratio of flux density per unit area between the targets to Kalliope's measured emissivity, we find that Linus' emissivity is 0.73$0.17 at 9 mm.\n\n",

The dielectric constant of the solid material is highly sensitive to the metal content, which may be in the form of minerals or of metallic inclusions; the latter scenario requires a much lower metal content to match the observations . Based on Kalliope's 1--9 mm emissivities, the upper $100 $ranges of 80-370 for Psyche and 25-440 for Kalliope.

However, spatially resolved thermal observations such as those presented here remove much of the degeneracy between thermal inertia and emissivity. At millimeter wavelengths, both M and S type asteroids show a morning to afternoon temperature contrast []dekleer2021,junoalma.

At 9--20 mm wavelengths, although the data are not well enough resolved spatially to constrain the diurnal temperature variations, the subsurface temperature profile is close to isothermal at the relevant depths due to the pole-on viewing geometry such that subsurface emission cannot account for the low brightness temperatures at these wavelengths either.  \n\nSince the low emissivity of Kalliope cannot be accounted for by emission from a cold subsurface, it must be due to the material properties of the surface. While models can be used to interpret emissivity in terms of porosity and metal content, simple conversions between these properties cannot account for variations in emissivity with wavelength. Figure shows our 1.3, 9 and 20 mm measurements compared to the surface temperature of Kalliope at the time of observation.
