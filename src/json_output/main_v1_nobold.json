                "content": "Shadows are a common feature of protoplanetary disks observed in scattered light images . These shadows are evident in various systems, including narrow shadows observed in HD 142527 , HD 100453 , RX J1604.3-2130 A , DoAr 44 , SU Aur , GG Tau A , CV Cha , HD 135344B , and CQ Tau , as well as wide shadows in ZZ Tau IRS , TW Hya , HD 139614 , HD 169142 , HD 143006 , PDS 66 , and HD 163296 . Many of these disks are classified as transition disks , characterized by a large inner cavity, often accompanied by unresolved inner disks.\n\nThe presence of both inner and outer disks suggests a geometric explanation for the observed shadows: a misalignment between the inner and outer disks causes the inner disk to cast a shadow on the outer disk . The shadow's extent is influenced by the degree of mutual inclination: mild inclination results in wide shadows, while a highly inclined configuration produces narrow shadow lanes . Many mechanisms could cause misaligned inner and outer disks, including an inclined planet , a misaligned central binary , a late infall , and a stellar flyby . Shadows can also be cast by other obscurations, such as dust clumps , magnetospheric accretion onto the star , infall , or even a planet with a circumplanetary disk .\n\nEvidence of shadows has also been accumulated from ALMA observations. The drops of dust continuum emission in HD 142527 , DoAr 44 , and CQ Tau  are aligned with their shadows. The azimuthal variation of CO emission is also aligned with shadows in RXJ1604.3â€“2130 A . The azimuthal C/O variations in HD 100546 has been attributed to temperature variations caused by shadows .\n\nMost previous studies focused on how disk structures affect shadow appearance, such as interpreting inner disk geometry []marino15, precession rates from multi-epoch observations , and surface density and cooling rates from azimuthal temperature variations . More dedicated studies post-processed hydrodynamical simulations with Monte Carlo Radiative Transfer codes to produce dust and gas emissions . However, shadows can also affect disk dynamics. Shadows lower temperature, and thus pressure, creating a pressure difference between shadowed and unshadowed regions, and providing a persistent asymmetric driving force. performed 2D hydrodynamical simulations considering the dynamic effects of shadows, though with simplified heating/cooling treatments. While we were at the final stage of our paper preparation, conducted a 2D parameter space study on substructures due to shadows, and performed a 3D simulation to study the role of shadows on disk eccentricity, both with simplified heating/cooling.\n\nIn this letter, we present the first 3D radiation hydrodynamical simulation to study shadows cast on outer transition disks. We focus on a simple configuration of a non-precessing inner disk perpendicular to an optically thin outer disk, examining the dynamical impact by shadows and discuss observational implications on scattered light morphology and ALMA kinematics of shadowed protoplanetary disks. In a subsequent article, we will present a more complete parameter study on shadows in disks. Section details our methods, Section presents our main findings, and Section discusses the observational implications, with our conclusions summarized in Section .\n\n",

                "content": "The outer disk setup is similar to that of , featuring a power law surface density, an inner truncation, and an exponential cutoff. We created a wide cavity size of 160 au to keep the disk optically thin to stellar irradiation and to provide ample space for studying the dynamics within the cavity. The gas surface density is given by:\n\n_=& _& & ,\n\twhere $_= 40 au. Following , $_. If there were no cavity, the disk mass would be 0.01 M$_= 0 and $is the optical depth at the optical frequency (peak of the stellar spectrum) in the radial direction. The parameters $represent the attenuation amplitude and the ramp-up time for this attenuation, respectively, and $is the waiting time before we introduce shadows. This relaxation time allows the axisymmetric disk to settle to the equilibrium thermal state from the initial locally isothermal state. In other words, there is no shadow from t=0 to $t_to $t_, the shadows gradually reach their full amplitudes. We adopted $= 0.9$, which means that the inner disk provides at most $2$ attenuation. $t_to 10 P$_0$, where P$_0$ ($=0.5) as the dynamical effects are stronger. \n\nAs for opacity, we used the DSHARP composition and a power law MRN dust size distribution []mathis77. The minimum grain size $a_m and maximum grain size $a_m, which account for f$_80$^. For the hydro boundary conditions, we used modified outflow boundary conditions for the inner, outer, upper, and lower boundaries. This means that if the fluid at the boundary is flowing out of the domain, we copy the quantities to the ghost cells as a typical outflow setup. Otherwise, we assign zero velocity in this direction in the ghost cells to avoid the inflow. As for radiation boundary conditions, light beams can freely transport out of the domain. If the beam points inward the computational domain, the radiation is assumed to have the background temperature (10 K), which is a typical temperature of molecular clouds. We adopted periodic boundary condition in the azimuthal $. Then we placed a vertically aligned inner disk with its axis aligned with the y-axis (its midplane aligned with the x-z plane). We assumed the inner disk ranges from 3 $r_m) polarized scattered light images in the face-on configuration. For ALMA kinematic observations, we assumed that the abundance of $^12of the total gas mass everywhere to calculate the emission surface of $^12=0 and $g cm$^-20.1 inside the cavity and $300 au), one spiral could break into two. The ring connected to the inner spirals (between 150-200 au) also show azimuthal density variation. Eventually, two vortices form and merge into one after another 100 P$_0$ (see Figure attached movies and also Figure ). The radial velocity $v_R$ (third column) follows the spiral shapes, with some parts of the spirals flowing inward (in blue) and others flowing outward (in red), which is typical for spiral waves. However, at the midplane, the highest density regions of the spirals tend to align with the inflow, consistent with the accumulation of mass in the cavity throughout the evolution.\n\nThe vertical velocity ($v_Z$, fourth column) is close to zero at the midplane, indicating that our simulation maintains symmetry across the midplane, and vertical shear instability does not occur due to our low resolution (around five cells per scale height). At around one to two gas scale heights (second row), both the cavity and ring regions show alternating m=2 upward (red) and downward (blue) motions (the direction of $v_Z$ changes sign at each quadrant), which are not related to the spirals but are a unique steady-state solution for a 3D disk with two shadows, as we will detail in Section . The azimuthal velocity subtracted by $v_K$ is shown in the fifth column, where the disturbances follow the spirals. The overall azimuthally averaged radial profile of $v_=0 and the other at $. Assuming the orbital frequency of the gas disk $R^-_, the spiral arm should follow:\n\n= 1-_+(c_s(R_pl)- c_s(R)) + _pl,\nwhere $R_plare the launching radius and azimuthal angle of the perturbation. The tangent of the pitch angle is simply the ratio between the local sound speed and orbital speed:\n\n() = - R(R).\nTo test this theory, we ran a 2D isothermal simulation ($_=0), with constant temperature ($h/r$ = 0.1) and surface density ($_0$) across all radii, rotating at Keplerian speed. We enforced the density at r=160 au and $to 1.001 $_0$ at each time step to produce a persistent perturbation at a point source. Once the simulation started, two spirals were launched and propagated inward and outward through the disk at the local sound speed in the radial direction and the local Keplerian speed in the azimuthal direction. At a steady state (Figure , first row), Equation (marked by cross signs) tracks the inward-propagating spiral perfectly. We note that a secondary inner spiral arm occurs around 80 au, which is due to an interference pattern not tracked by this formula . We then applied Equation to our radiation-hydro simulation and focused on the midplane slice from early to late stages (Figure , second to fourth rows). In the beginning of the linear growth phase (t=23.8 P$_0$) when the shadow is still strengthening, the spiral arms follow Equation perfectly. At later stages, vortices form inside the cavity and ring, making the pattern unstable, even though the pitch angle tends to agree with the analytical formula near the launching point. The spirals tend to open up (third row), likely due to the nonlinear shock propagation , especially when the density waves travel inwards from the high density to low density region. But from time to time, they realign with the linear phase pitch angle (e.g., t=373.4 P$_0$ inside 60 au).\n\nFrom Figure , it is evident that the mass in the cavity increases with time, indicating that the spirals drive accretion. We calculated the azimuthally-averaged surface density evolution in Figure (first row) to confirm this point. As shown in the first row, the surface density at 40 au has increased by two orders of magnitude over 300 P$_0$. To further quantify the accretion by the spirals, we calculated the vertically integrated $_R. Here, $_,tand time between 178.56 to 218.24 $P_0$. Note that the underlying assumption for azimuthally averaging is that quantities should be uniform in the background state across $is $10^-2at the cavity edge.\nWe also integrated $v_R _,tcan also be estimated from the radial gradient of $equals the midplane Keplerian speed $v_K$.\n\nFigure (third row) shows the measured and estimated accretion rates. Despite the approximations made in calculating $_, two curves align quite well. This exercise confirms that the spirals launched by shadows drive accretion at the rate of $10^-10M$_in our simulation.\n\n",

                "content": "With our 3D simulation, we could also study the vertical kinematics due to shadows. In Figure , we have shown that $v_Z$ changes sign in each quadrant. This behavior seems peculiar, as one might expect the gas motion to follow the thermal structure. Specifically, when gas is in shadow, the temperature decreases, leading the gas to collapse toward the midplane, while outside the shadow, the higher temperature would cause the gas to puff up. However, the vertical gas motion does not follow the shadow exactly because the vertical structure does not have enough time to adjust itself. The adjustment takes several sound crossing time or orbital time ($H$/$c_s$ $^-1is the stellar gravity. A classical axisymmetric vertical structure would balance the vertical pressure gradient $P/Z$ and vertical gravity $g_z$. However, by examining all the terms in $Z$-component of the momentum equation, we found that an azimuthal convective accretion term $R^-1_(v_v_Z)$ becomes crucial to balance the difference, such that\nZ- g_z  + R= 0.\nFigure demonstrates the balance of terms along a circle at $r=$200 au and 0.2 radians above the midplane ($. The pressure gradient varies more and is lower than the gravity term inside the shadow and higher outside the shadow. The vertical lines mark the azimuthal locations where these two terms balance. The blue line in the third row shows the difference between the pressure gradient and gravity, which is almost balanced by the convective acceleration term $R^-1_(v_v_Z)$ shown in magenta. Since $v_-v_K$ is much less than $v_K$, the primary contribution to this term is from $v_Z$. That is, when $v_Z$/$is negative, $v_Z$ decreases. The $v_Z$ in the fourth row matches its derivatives perfectly, with the turning points aligning with the zero points in the third row. In fact, our intuition in the beginning of this subsection would be correct if we relate shadow with acceleration, instead of velocity. When a fluid parcel reaches the shadow, it feels a downward acceleration, but the parcel is still moving up so it takes some azimuthal angle for it to move down. Similarly, outside the shadow, the parcel feels an upward acceleration, but since it is moving downward so it takes a certain azimuthal angle for it to move up again. The magnitude of the vertical velocity can reach 10",

These velocity components are all asymmetric, and some have m=2 pattern. Finally, the azimuthal velocity behaves more symmetrically, but the change from sub-Keplerian to super-Keplerian velocities along the azimuthal direction may still be detectable. Additionally, the changing sign of velocity at ($x$,$y$)$if $h/r = 0.1$.\nThese spirals lead to mass accretion of $10^-10M$_within the cavity with $_int10^-2at the cavity edge.\nSpiral arms, vortices, and flocculent streamers produced by shadows can be seen in the scattered light images which resemble observations. While spirals are the immediate feature caused by shadows, other features can disturb spirals, such as vortices.\nThe shadowed disk has a unique steady-state solution in the vertical direction. In addition to the vertical pressure gradient and gravity, an azimuthal convective acceleration term is needed to balance the vertical momentum equation. This term contributes to the azimuthal variation of vertical velocity, leading to alternating upward and downward gas motions, which can be probed by optically thick ALMA line emissions such as $^12",
