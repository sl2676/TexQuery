The next decade will transform our understanding of the universe and humanity's place in it.  Every decade the U.S. agencies that provide primary federal funding for astronomy and astrophysics request a survey to assess the status of, and opportunities for the Nation's efforts to forward our understanding of the cosmos. Pathways to Discovery in Astronomy and Astrophysics for the 2020s identifies the most compelling science goals and presents an ambitious program of ground- and space-based activities for future investment in the next decade and beyond.  The decadal survey identifies three important science themes for the next decade aimed at investigating Earth-like extrasolar planets, the most energetic processes in the universe, and the evolution of galaxies.  The Astro2020 report also recommends critical near-term actions to support the foundations of the profession as well as the technologies and tools needed to carry out the science.",  url       = "https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/26141/pathways-to-discovery-in-astronomy-and-astrophysics-for-the-2020s",

@article{Yakovlev2018,
	Abstract = {An inversion of SiO2 and MgO volatility occurs during high-temperature melt evaporation in the CaO--MgO--Al2O3--SiO2 (CMAS) system. This results in that SiO2, which is usually more volatile than MgO, becomes less volatile during the evaporation of melts enriched in the refractory oxides CaO and Al2O3. The volatility inversion is adequately explained within the theory of acid--base interaction of silicate melt components developed by D.S. Korzhinskii. The compositions of high-Al2O3 and SiO2-poor glasses (known as HASP glasses) from the lunar regolith show a systematic decrease in MgO/SiO2 with increasing CaO content, which is a direct consequence of the influence of acid--base effects.},
