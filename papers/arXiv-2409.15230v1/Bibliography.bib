 abstract = {  By combining advances in observational astrophysics with recent progress in stellar evolution, we show that there will be a remarkably high number of black holes with compact object (neutron star or black hole) companions in the local Universe. Data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (300,000 galaxies) indicates that recent star formation (within the last 1 billion years) is bimodal: half the stars form from gas with high amounts of metals (solar metallicity), and the other half form with small contribution of elements heavier than Helium (20% solar). Theoretical studies of mass loss derive significantly higher stellar-origin black hole masses (30-80 Msun) than previously estimated for sub-solar compositions. We combine these findings to estimate the probability for detection of gravitational waves arising from the inspiral of double compact objects. Our results show that a low metallicity environment significantly boosts the formation of double compact object binaries with at least one black hole. In particular, we find the gravitational-wave detection rate is increased by a factor of 20 if the metallicity is decreased from solar (as in all previous estimates) to a 50-50 mixture of solar and 10% solar metallicity. The current sensitivity of the largest instruments to double neutron-star binaries (VIRGO: 9 Mpc; LIGO: 18) is not high enough to ensure a first detection. However, our results indicate that if a future instrument increased the reach to 50-100Mpc, a detection of gravitational waves would be expected within the first year of observation. It was previously thought that binary neutron stars were the most likely source, but our results indicate that black-hole binaries are 25-times more likely. We are therefore truly on the cusp of seeing gravitational waves, and the first source ever to be seen is likely to be a black hole binary.},

A detailed analogy with annealing in solids provides a framework for optimization of the properties of very large and complex systems. This connection to statistical mechanics exposes new information and provides an unfamiliar perspective on traditional optimization problems and methods. }

                   estimated using matched filtering of
                   gravitational-waveform templates against the output
                   of laser-interferometric gravitational-wave
                   detectors. The estimates are most sensitive to the
                   accuracy with which the phases of the template and
                   signal waveforms match over the many cycles received
                   in the detector frequency bandwidth. Using a recently
                   calculated formula, accurate to second post-Newtonian
                   (2PN) order [order (v/c)4, where v is the orbital
                   velocity], for the frequency sweep (dF/dt) induced by
                   gravitational radiation damping, we study the
                   statistical errors in the determination of such
                   source parameters as the ``chirp mass'' scrM, reduced
                   mass Î¼, and spin parameters Î² and Ï (related to
                   spin-orbit and spin-spin effects, respectively). We
                   find that previous results using template phasing
                   accurate to 1.5PN order actually underestimated the
                   errors in scrM, Î¼, and Î². Templates with 2PN
                   phasing yield somewhat larger measurement errors
                   because the 2PN corrections act to suppress slightly
                   the importance of spin-orbit contributions to the
                   phase, thereby increasing the measurement error on
                   Î². This, in turn, results in larger measurement
                   errors on scrM and Î¼ because of the strong
                   correlations among the parameters. For two
                   inspiraling neutron stars, the measurement errors
                   increase by less than 16%.},

Advanced Virgo will be part of a network, alongside the two Advanced LIGO detectors in the US and GEO HF in Germany, with the goal of contributing to the early detection of gravitational waves and to opening a new window of observation on the universe. In this paper we describe the main features of the Advanced Virgo detector and outline the status of the construction.}

Target coordinates were transmitted to several telescopes for follow-up observations aimed at the detection of an associated optical transient. Images were obtained for eight such GW candidates. We present the methods used to analyze the image data as well as the transient search results. No optical transient was identified with a convincing association with any of these candidates, and none of the GW triggers showed strong evidence for being astrophysical in nature. We compare the sensitivities of these observations to several model light curves from possible sources of interest, and discuss prospects for future joint GW-optical observations of this type.}

	abstract = {We present the first multi-wavelength follow-up observations of two candidate gravitational-wave (GW) transient events recorded by LIGO and Virgo in their 2009–2010 science run. The events were selected with low latency by the network of GW detectors (within less than 10 minutes) and their candidate sky locations were observed by the Swift observatory (within 12 hr). Image transient detection was used to analyze the collected electromagnetic data, which were found to be consistent with background. Off-line analysis of the GW data alone has also established that the selected GW events show no evidence of an astrophysical origin; one of them is consistent with background and the other one was a test, part of a “blind injection challenge.” With this work we demonstrate the feasibility of rapid follow-ups of GW transients and establish the sensitivity improvement joint electromagnetic and GW observations could bring. This is a first step toward an electromagnetic follow-up program in the regime of routine detections with the advanced GW instruments expected within this decade. In that regime, multi-wavelength observations will play a significant role in completing the astrophysical identification of GW sources. We present the methods and results from this first combined analysis and discuss its implications in terms of sensitivity for the present and future instruments.}

 abstract = {  We perform spherically-symmetric general-relativistic simulations of core collapse and the postbounce preexplosion phase in 32 presupernova stellar models of solar metallicity with zero-age-main-sequence masses of 12 M_{sun} to 120 M_{sun}. Using energy-dependent three-species neutrino transport in the two-moment approximation with an analytic closure, we show that the emitted neutrino luminosities and spectra follow very systematic trends that are correlated with the compactness (~M/R) of the progenitor star's inner regions via the accretion rate in the preexplosion phase. We find that these qualitative trends depend only weakly on the nuclear equation of state, but quantitative observational statements will require independent constraints on the equation of state and the rotation rate of the core as well as a more complete understanding of neutrino oscillations. We investigate the simulated response of water Cherenkov detectors to the electron antineutrino fluxes from our models and find that the large statistics of a galactic core collapse event may allow robust conclusions on the inner structure of the progenitor star.},

   abstract = {Massive stars present strong stellar that which are described by the radiation driven wind theory. Accurate mass-loss rates are necessary to properly describe the stellar evolution across the Hertzsprung--Russel Diagram. We present a self-consistent procedure that coupled the hydrodynamics with calculations of the line-force, giving as results the line-force parameters, the velocity field, and the mass-loss rate. Our calculations contemplate the contribution to the line-force multiplier from more than $\sim 900,000$ atomic transitions, an NLTE radiation flux from the photosphere and a quasi-LTE approximation for the occupational numbers. A full set of line-force parameters for $T_\text\{eff\}\ge 32,000$ K, surface gravities higher than 3.4 dex for two different metallicities are presented, with their corresponding wind parameters (terminal velocities and mass-loss rates). The already known dependence of line-force parameters on effective temperature is enhanced by the dependence on $\log g$. The terminal velocities present a stepper scaling relation with respect to the escape velocity, this might explain the scatter values observed in the hot side of the bistability jump. Moreover, a comparison of self-consistent mass-loss rates with empirical values shows a good agreement. Self-consistent wind solutions are used as input in FASTWIND to calculate synthetic spectra. We show, comparing with the observed spectra for three stars, that varying the clumping factor, the synthetic spectra rapidly converge into the neighbourhood region of the solution. It is important to stress that our self-consistent procedure significantly reduces the number of free parameters needed to obtain a synthetic spectrum.},

   abstract = {Aims. We performed a spectral fitting for a set of O-type stars based on self-consistent wind solutions, which provide mass-loss rate and velocity profiles directly derived from the initial stellar parameters. The great advantage of this self-consistent spectral fitting is therefore the reduction of the number of free parameters to be tuned. Methods. Self-consistent values for the line-force parameters (k, α, δ)sc and subsequently for the mass-loss rate, Msc, and terminal velocity, v∞,sc, are provided by the m-CAK prescription introduced in Paper I, which is updated in this work with improvements such as a temperature structure T(r) for the wind that are self-consistently evaluated from the line-acceleration. Synthetic spectra were calculated using the radiative transfer code FASTWIND, replacing the classical β-law for our new calculated velocity profiles v(r) and therefore making clumping the only free parameter for the stellar wind. Results. We found that self-consistent m-CAK solutions provide values for theoretical mass-loss rates of the order of the most recent predictions of other studies. From here, we generate synthetic spectra with self-consistent hydrodynamics to fit and obtain a new set of stellar and wind parameters for our sample of O-type stars (HD 192639, 9 Sge, HD 57682, HD 218915, HD 195592, and HD 210809), whose spectra were taken with the high-resolution echelle spectrograph HERMES (R = 85 000). We find a satisfactory global fit for our observations, with a good accuracy for photospheric He I and He II lines and a quite acceptable fit for H lines. Although this self-consistent spectral analysis is currently constrained in the optical wavelength range alone, this is an important step towards the determination of stellar and wind parameters without using a β-law. Based on the variance of the line-force parameters, we establish that our method is valid for O-type stars with Teff a ¥ 30 kK and log g a ¥ 3.2. Given these results, we expect that the values introduced here are helpful for future studies of the stars constituting this sample, together with the prospect that the m-CAK self-consistent prescription may be extended to numerous studies of massive stars in the future.},

A better comprehension of this phenomenon, and a more accurate calculation of hydrodynamics and radiative acceleration is required to reduce the number of free parameters in spectral fitting, to determine accurate wind parameters such as mass-loss rates and velocity profiles. We use the non-LTE model-atmosphere code CMFGEN to numerically solve the radiative transfer equation in the stellar atmosphere and to calculate the radiative acceleration $g_\text\{rad\}(r)$. Under the assumption that the radiative acceleration depends only on the radial coordinate, we solve analytically the equation of motion by means of the Lambert $W$-function. An iterative procedure between the solution of the radiative transfer and the equation of motion is executed in order to obtain a final self-consistent velocity field that is no longer based on any $\beta$-law. We apply the Lambert-procedure to three O supergiant stars ($\zeta$-Puppis, HD~165763 and $\alpha$-Cam) and discuss the Lambert-solutions for the velocity profiles. It is found that, even without recalculation of the mass-loss rate, the Lambert-procedure allows the calculation of consistent velocity profiles that reduce the number of free parameters when a spectral fitting using CMFGEN is performed. Synthetic spectra calculated from our Lambert-solutions show significant differences compared to the initial $\beta$-law CMFGEN models. The results indicate the importance of consistent velocity profile calculation in the CMFGEN code and its usage in a fitting procedure and interpretation of observed spectra.},

   abstract = {Massive stars lose a large fraction of their mass to radiation-driven winds throughout their entire life. These outflows impact both the life and death of these stars and their surroundings. Theoretical mass-loss rates of hot, massive stars are derived to be used in applications such as stellar evolution. The behaviour of these rates in the OB-star regime is analysed, and their effects on massive-star evolution predictions is studied. Dynamically-consistent models are computed by solving the spherically symmetric, steady-state equation-of-motion for a large grid of hot, massive stars. The radiative acceleration is derived from non-local thermodynamic equilibrium radiative transfer in the co-moving frame. The resulting mass-loss rates are used to derive a simple scaling recipe with stellar parameters and to evaluate some first impacts upon evolution tracks. We provide a new prescription for steady-state, radiation-driven mass-loss from hot, massive stars depending on their fundamental parameters. The rates for O-stars are lower by about a factor ~3 than the rates typically used in previous stellar-evolution calculations, where differences generally decrease with increasing luminosity and temperature. For cooler B-giants/supergiants we find larger discrepancies. This arises because we do not find any systematic increase in mass-loss rates below the so-called bi-stability region; indeed, our results do not show any sign of a significant bi-stability jump within the parameter range covered by the grid. Due to the lower mass-loss rates we find that envelopes are not easily stripped by means of standard steady-state winds, making it difficult to create classical Wolf-Rayet stars via this channel. However, a remaining key uncertainty regarding these predictions concerns unsteady mass loss for very high-luminosity stars close to the Eddington limit as well as the impact of non-line-driven winds.},

   abstract = {Context. Radiation-driven mass loss plays a key role in the life cycles of massive stars. However, basic predictions of such mass loss still suffer from significant quantitative uncertainties. Aims. We develop new radiation-driven, steady-state wind models for massive stars with hot surfaces, suitable for quantitative predictions of global parameters like mass-loss and wind-momentum rates. Methods. The simulations presented here are based on a self-consistent, iterative grid solution to the spherically symmetric, steady-state equation of motion, using full non-local thermodynamic equilibrium radiative transfer solutions in the co-moving frame to derive the radiative acceleration. We do not rely on any distribution functions or parametrization for computation of the line force responsible for the wind driving. The models start deep in the subsonic and optically thick atmosphere and extend up to a large radius at which the terminal wind speed has been reached. Results. In this first paper, we present models representing two prototypical O-stars in the Galaxy, one with a higher stellar mass M∗ Mpdbl = 59 and luminosity log10L∗L = 5.87 (spectroscopically an early O supergiant) and one with a lower M∗Mpdbl = 27 and log10L∗ L- = 5.1 (a late O dwarf). For these simulations, basic predictions for global mass-loss rates, velocity laws, and wind momentum are given, and the influence from additional parameters like wind clumping and microturbulent speeds is discussed. A key result is that although our mass-loss rates agree rather well with alternative models using co-moving frame radiative transfer, they are significantly lower than those predicted by the mass-loss recipes normally included in models of massive-star evolution. Conclusions. Our results support previous suggestions that Galactic O-star mass-loss rates may be overestimated in present-day stellar evolution models, and that new rates might therefore be needed. Indeed, future papers in this series will incorporate our new models into such simulations of stellar evolution, extending the very first simulations presented here toward larger grids covering a range of metallicities, B supergiants across the bistability jump, and possibly also Wolf-Rayet stars.},

The models are calculated by solving hydrodynamic, kinetic equilibrium (also known as NLTE) and comoving frame (CMF) radiative transfer equations from the (nearly) hydrostatic photosphere to the supersonic wind. For given stellar parameters, our models predict the photosphere and wind structure and in particular the wind mass-loss rates without any free parameters. Our predicted mass-loss rates are by a factor of 2-5 lower than the commonly used predictions. A possible cause of the difference is abandoning of the Sobolev approximation for the calculation of the radiative force, because our models agree with predictions of CMF NLTE radiative transfer codes. Our predicted mass-loss rates agree nicely with the mass-loss rates derived from observed near-infrared and X-ray line profiles and are slightly lower than mass-loss rates derived from combined UV and Hα diagnostics. The empirical mass-loss rate estimates corrected for clumping may therefore be reconciled with theoretical predictions in such a way that the average ratio between individual mass-loss rate estimates is not higher than about 1.6. On the other hand, our predictions are by factor of 4.7 lower than pure Hα mass-loss rate estimates and can be reconciled with these values only assuming a microclumping factor of at least eight.},

We have conducted a quantitative analysis using the two NLTE model atmosphere and wind codes, TLUSTY and CMFGEN, which incorporate a detailed treatment of NLTE metal line blanketing. From the far-UV spectrum, we have derived the stellar and wind parameters and the surface composition of the two stars. The surface of HD 190429A has a composition typical of an evolved O supergiant (nitrogen-rich, carbon and oxygen-poor), while HD 96715 exhibits surface nitrogen enhancement similar to the enrichment found in SMC O dwarfs which has been attributed to rotationally-induced mixing. Following studies of Magellanic Cloud O stars, we find that homogeneous wind models could not match the observed profile of 0 vλ 1371 and require very low phosphorus abundance to fit the P Vλλ1118-1128 resonance lines. We show, on the other hand, that we are able to match the O V and P V lines using clumped wind models. In addition to these lines, we find that N IV/λ718 is also sensitive to wind clumping. For both stars, we have calculated clumped wind models that match well all these lines from different species and that remain consistent with Hα data. In particular, we have achieved an excellent match of the P v resonance doublet, indicating that our physical description of clumping is adequate. These fits therefore provide a coherent and thus much stronger evidence of wind clumping in O stars than earlier claims. We show that the success of the clumped wind models in matching these lines results from increased recombination in the clumps, hence from a better description of the wind ionization structure. We find that the wind of these two stars is highly clumped, as expressed by very small volume filling factors, namely f ∞ = 0.04 for HD 190429A and f∞ = 0.02 for HD 96715. In agreement with our analysis of SMC stars, clumping starts deep in the wind, just above the sonic point. The most crucial consequence of our analysis is that the mass loss rates of O stars need to be revised downward significantly, by a factor of 3 and more. These lower mass loss rates will affect substantially the evolution of massive stars. Accounting for wind clumping is essential when determining the wind properties of O stars. Our study therefore calls for a fundamental revision in our understanding of mass loss and of O-type star stellar winds. © ESO 2005.},

Using the non-LTE wind code cmfgen we simultaneously analyzed the FUV-UV and optical spectral range to determine the photospheric properties and wind parameters. We derived effective temperatures, luminosities, surface gravities, surface abundances, mass-loss rates, wind terminal velocities, and clumping filling factors. Results. The supergiants define a very clear evolutionary sequence, in terms of ages and masses, from younger and more massive stars to older stars with lower initial masses. O4 supergiants cluster around the 3 Myr isochrone and are more massive than 60 M ⊙, while the O5 to O7.5 stars have masses in the range 50-40 M ⊙ and are 4 ± 0.3 Myr old. The surface chemical composition is typical of evolved O supergiants (nitrogen-rich, carbon-and oxygen-poor). While the observed ranges of carbon and nitrogen mass-fractions are compatible with those expected from evolutionary models for the measured stellar masses, the N/C ratios as a function of age are inconsistent with the theoretical predictions for the four earliest (O4 spectral type) stars of the sample. We question the efficiency of rotational mixing as a function of age for these stars and suggest that another mechanism may be needed to explain the observed abundance patterns. Mass-loss rates derived with clumped-models range within a factor of three of the theoretical mass-loss rates.

   abstract = {Context. Recent studies of O-type stars have demonstrated that discrepant mass-loss rates are obtained when different diagnostic methods are employed. Fitting the unsaturated UV resonance lines (e.g., P v) gives drastically lower values than obtained from the Hα emission. Wind inhomogeneity (so-called "clumping") may be the main cause of this discrepancy. Aims. In a previous paper, we presented 3D Monte-Carlo calculations for the formation of scattering lines in a clumped stellar wind. In the present paper we select five O-type supergiants (from O4 to O7) and test whether the reported discrepancies can be resolved this way. Methods. In the first step, the analyses started with simulating the observed spectra with Potsdam Wolf-Rayet (PoWR) non-LTE model atmospheres. The mass-loss rates are adjusted to fit to the observed Hα emission lines best. For the unsaturated UV resonance lines (i.e., P v) we then applied our 3D Monte-Carlo code, which can account for wind clumps of any optical depths ("macroclumping"), a non-void interclump medium, and a velocity dispersion inside the clumps. The ionization stratifications and underlying photospheric spectra were adopted from the PoWR models. The properties of the wind clumps were constrained by fitting the observed resonance line profiles. Results. Our results show that with the mass-loss rates that fit Hα (and other Balmer and He ii lines), the UV resonance lines (especially the unsaturated doublet of P v) can also be reproduced with no problem when macroclumping is taken into account. There is no need to artificially reduce the mass-loss rates or to assume a subsolar phosphorus abundance or an extremely high clumping factor, unlike what was claimed by other authors. These consistent mass-loss rates are lower by a factor of 1.3 to 2.6, compared to the mass-loss rate recipe from Vink et al. Conclusions. Macroclumping resolves the previously reported discrepancy between Hα and P v mass-loss diagnostics. © 2013 ESO.},

   abstract = {The most massive stars are thought to lose a significant fraction of their mass in a steady wind during the main-sequence and blue supergiant phases. This in turn sets the stage for their further evolution and eventual supernova, and preconditions the surrounding medium for all following events, with consequences for ISM energization, chemical enrichment, and dust formation. Understanding these processes requires accurate observational constraints on the mass-loss rates of the most luminous stars, which can also be used to test theories of stellar wind driving. In the past, mass-loss rates have been characterized via collisional emission processes such as optical Hα and free-free radio emission, but these so-called “density squared” diagnostics require correction in the presence of widespread clumping. Recent observational and theoretical evidence points to the likelihood of a ubiquitously high level of such clumping in hot-star winds, but quantifying its effects requires a deeper understanding of the complex dynamics of radiatively driven winds and their stochastic instabilities. Furthermore, large-scale structures initiating in surface anisotropies and propagating throughout the wind can also affect wind driving and alter mass-loss diagnostics. Time series spectroscopy of high resonance-line opacity in the UV, capable of high resolution and high signal-to-noise, are required to better understand these complex dynamics, and more accurately determine mass-loss rates. The proposed Polstar mission (Scowen et al. 2022, this volume) provides the necessary resolution at the Sobolev (∼10 km s−1) or sound-speed (∼20 km s−1) scale, for over three dozen bright galactic massive stars with signal-to noise an order of magnitude above that of the celebrated MEGA campaign (Massa et al. 1995) of the International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE), via continuous observations that track propagating structures through the winds in real time.

   abstract = {The authors describe results of numerical radiation-hydrodynamics simulations of the nonlinear evolution of instabilities in radiatively driven stellar winds. The wind is idealized as a spherically symmetric, isothermal flow driven by pure absorption of stellar radiation in a fixed ensemble of spectral lines. The simulations indicate that there is a strong tendency for the unstable flow to form rather sharp rarefactions in which the highest speed material has very low density. The growth of wave perturbations thus remains nearly exponential well beyond the linear regime, until the waves are kinematically steepened into strong shocks. The strongest shocks here are reverse shocks that arise to decelerate high-speed, rarefied flow as it impacts slower material that has been compressed into dense shells. The subsequent wind evolution shows a slow decay of the shocks and the gradual thermal decompression and interaction of the dense shells.},
