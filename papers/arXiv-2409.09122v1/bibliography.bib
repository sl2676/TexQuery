Part I discusses the theory of GWs, re-deriving afresh and in a coherent way all the results presented. Both the geometrical and the field-theoretical approach to general relativity are discussed. The generation of GWs is discussed first in linearized theory (including the general multipole expansion) and then within the post-Newtonian formalism. Many important calculations (inspiral of compact binaries, GW emission by rotating or precessing bodies, infall into black holes, etc.) are presented. The observation of GWs emission from the change in the orbital period of binary pulsar, such as the Hulse-Taylor pulsar and the double pulsar, is also explained, and the pulsar timing formula is derived. Part II discusses the principles of GW experiments, going into the detail of the functioning of both interferometers and resonant-mass detectors. One chapter is devoted to the data analysis techniques relevant for GW experiments.}",

  abstract = {We perform Monte Carlo simulation experiments in two-dimensional (E and J) phase space to compute the quasi-steady distribution of stars around a massive black hole in the isothermal core of a star cluster. We also determine in detail the rate at which stars bound to the black hole in the cusp are consumed near the cluster center (e.g., due to tidal disruption by the hole) and the associated rate at which energy flows out of the cusp and into the ambient core. Although the calculated distribution function and density profile exhibit significant depletion near the disruption radius due to the consumption of stars in highly eccentric (``loss-cone'') orbits, they are in good agreement with the one-dimensional results of Bahcall and Wolf in the outer, (potentially) observable portions of the cusp for typical globular core parameters. Our calculations confirm the estimates of Frank and Rees and of Lightman and Shapiro for the stellar consumption rate (and its influence on the distribution function) and provide reliable numerical coefficients for their scaling relations.},

  abstract = {The steady-state distribution of stars around a massive black hole in a globular cluster is determined by solving numerically the coupled time-dependent Boltzmann equations for a system containing stars of two different masses. Similar results are found for an arbitrary spectrum of masses with the aid of approximate analytic solutions of the time-independent equations. The effects of mass segregation are summarized by scaling laws that are derived both by analytic approximations and by numerical solutions. The detectability of a black hole in a globular cluster is discussed in terms of possible observations of the central star distributions.}
