@article{Gao_hazes,
	abstract = {The observed mass─radius relationship of low-mass planets informs our understanding of their composition and evolution. Recent discoveries of low-mass, large-radius objects ("super-puffs") have challenged theories of planet formation and atmospheric loss, as their high inferred gas masses make them vulnerable to runaway accretion and hydrodynamic escape. Here we propose that high-altitude photochemical hazes could enhance the observed radii of low-mass planets and explain the nature of super-puffs. We construct model atmospheres in radiative-convective equilibrium and compute rates of atmospheric escape and haze distributions, taking into account haze coagulation, sedimentation, diffusion, and advection by an outflow wind. We develop mass─radius diagrams that include atmospheric lifetimes and haze opacity, which is enhanced by the outflow, such that young (∼0.1─1 Gyr), warm (T<SUB>eq</SUB> ≥ 500 K), low-mass objects (M<SUB>c</SUB> &lt; 4 M<SUB>⊕</SUB>) should experience the most apparent radius enhancement due to hazes, reaching factors of three. This reconciles the densities and ages of the most extreme super-puffs. For Kepler-51b, the inclusion of hazes reduces its inferred gas mass fraction to &lt;10%, similar to that of planets on the large-radius side of the sub-Neptune radius gap. This suggests that Kepler-51b may be evolving toward that population and that some warm sub-Neptunes may have evolved from super-puffs. Hazes also render transmission spectra of super-puffs and sub-Neptunes featureless, consistent with recent measurements. Our hypothesis can be tested by future observations of super-puffs' transmission spectra at mid-infrared wavelengths, where we predict that the planet radius will be half of that observed in the near-infrared.},

@article{Libby-Roberts:2020,
	abstract = {The Kepler mission revealed a class of planets known as "super-puffs," with masses only a few times larger than Earth's but radii larger than Neptune, giving them very low mean densities. All three of the known planets orbiting the young solar-type star Kepler 51 are super-puffs. The Kepler 51 system thereby provides an opportunity for a comparative study of the structures and atmospheres of this mysterious class of planets, which may provide clues about their formation and evolution. We observed two transits each of Kepler 51b and 51d with the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) on the Hubble Space Telescope. Combining new WFC3 transit times with reanalyzed Kepler data and updated stellar parameters, we confirmed that all three planets have densities lower than 0.1 g cm<SUP>−3</SUP>. We measured the WFC3 transmission spectra to be featureless between 1.15 and 1.63 μm, ruling out any variations greater than 0.6 scale heights (assuming a H/He-dominated atmosphere), thus showing no significant water absorption features. We interpreted the flat spectra as the result of a high-altitude aerosol layer (pressure &lt;3 mbar) on each planet. Adding this new result to the collection of flat spectra that have been observed for other sub-Neptune planets, we find support for one of the two hypotheses introduced by Crossfield &amp; Kreidberg, that planets with cooler equilibrium temperatures have more high-altitude aerosols. We strongly disfavor their other hypothesis that the H/He mass fraction drives the appearance of large-amplitude transmission features.},

	abstract = {We present the discovery of a transiting hot Jupiter orbiting HIP 67522 ($T_ eff \sim5650$ K; $M_* \sim 1.2 M_ \odot $) in the 10-20 Myr old Sco-Cen OB association. We identified the transits in the TESS data using our custom notch-filter planet search pipeline, and characterize the system with additional photometry from Spitzer, spectroscopy from SOAR/Goodman, SALT/HRS, LCOGT/NRES, and SMARTS/CHIRON, and speckle imaging from SOAR/HRCam. We model the photometry as a periodic Gaussian process with transits to account for stellar variability, and find an orbital period of 6.9596$^ +0.000016 _ -0.000015 $ days and radius of 10.02$^ +0.54 _ -0.53 $ R$_\oplus$. We also identify a single transit of an additional candidate planet with radius 8.01$^ +0.75 _ -0.71 $ R$_\oplus$ that has an orbital period of $\gtrsim23$ days. The validated planet HIP 67522 b is currently the youngest transiting hot Jupiter discovered and is an ideal candidate for transmission spectroscopy and radial velocity follow-up studies, while also demonstrating that some young giant planets either form in situ at small orbital radii, or else migrate promptly from formation sites farther out in the disk.},

	abstract = {Context. Transiting super-Earths orbiting bright stars in short orbital periods are interesting targets for the study of planetary atmospheres.  Aims: While selecting super-Earths suitable for further characterisation from the ground from a list of confirmed and validated exoplanets detected by K2, we found some suspicious cases that led to us reassess the nature of the detected transiting signal.  Methods: We performed a photometric analysis of the K2 light curves and centroid motions of the photometric barycenters.  Results: Our study shows that the validated planets K2-78b, K2-82b, and K2-92b are not planets, but background eclipsing binaries. The eclipsing binaries are inside the Kepler photometric aperture, but outside the ground-based high-resolution images that were used for validation.  Conclusions: We advise extreme care in the validation of candidate planets that are discovered by space missions. It is important that all the assumptions in the validation process are carefully checked. An independent confirmation is mandatory in order to avoid wasting valuable resources on further characterisation of non-existent targets.},

	abstract = {We study the orbital architecture, physical characteristics of planets, formation and long-term evolution of the Kepler-30 planetary system, detected and announced in 2012 by the Kepler team. We show that the Kepler-30 system belongs to a particular class of very compact and quasi-resonant, yet long-term stable planetary systems. We re-analyse the light curves of the host star spanning Q1-Q17 quarters of the Kepler mission. A huge variability of the Transit Timing Variations exceeding 2 d is induced by a massive Jovian planet located between two Neptune-like companions. The innermost pair is near to the 2:1 mean motion resonance (MMR), and the outermost pair is close to higher order MMRs, such as 17:7 and 7:3. Our re-analysis of photometric data allows us to constrain, better than before, the orbital elements, planets' radii, and masses, which are 9.2 $\pm$ 0.1, 536 $\pm$ 5, and 23.7 $\pm$ 1.3 Earth masses for Kepler-30b, Kepler-30c, and Kepler-30d, respectively. The masses of the inner planets are determined within ˜1 per cent uncertainty. We infer the internal structures of the Kepler-30 planets and their bulk densities in a wide range from 0.19 $\pm$ 0.01 g.cm-3 for Kepler-30d, 0.96 $\pm$ 0.15 g.cm-3 for Kepler-30b, to 1.71 $\pm$ 0.13 g.cm-3 for the Jovian planet Kepler-30c. We attempt to explain the origin of this unique planetary system and a deviation of the orbits from exact MMRs through the planetary migration scenario. We anticipate that the Jupiter-like planet plays an important role in determining the present dynamical state of this system.},

	abstract = {M subdwarfs are low-metallicity M dwarfs that typically inhabit the halo population of the Galaxy. Metallicity controls the opacity of stellar atmospheres; in metal-poor stars, hydrostatic equilibrium is reached at a smaller radius, leading to smaller radii for a given effective temperature. We compile a sample of 88 stars that span spectral classes K7 to M6 and include stars with metallicity classes from solar-metallicity dwarf stars to the lowest metallicity ultra subdwarfs to test how metallicity changes the stellar radius. We fit models to Palomar Double Spectrograph (DBSP) optical spectra to derive effective temperatures (T eff) and we measure bolometric luminosities (L bol) by combining broad wavelength-coverage photometry with Gaia parallaxes. Radii are then computed by combining the T eff and L bol using the Stefan--Boltzman law. We find that for a given temperature, ultra subdwarfs can be as much as five times smaller than their solar-metallicity counterparts. We present color-radius and color-surface brightness relations that extend down to [Fe/H] of -2.0 dex, in order to aid the radius determination of M subdwarfs, which will be especially important for the WFIRST exoplanetary microlensing survey.},

	abstract = {The role of stellar age in the measured properties and occurrence rates of exoplanets is not well understood. This is in part due to a paucity of known young planets and the uncertainties in age-dating for most exoplanet host stars. Exoplanets with well-constrained ages, particularly those which are young, are useful as benchmarks for studies aiming to constrain the evolutionary timescales relevant for planets. Such timescales may concern orbital migration, gravitational contraction, or atmospheric photoevaporation, among other mechanisms. Here we report the discovery of an adolescent transiting sub-Neptune from K2 photometry of the low-mass star EPIC 247267267. From multiple age indicators, we estimate the age of the star to be 120 Myr, with a 68% confidence interval of 100--760 Myr. The size of EPIC 247267267 b (R  P  = 2.8 $\pm$ 0.1 R ⊕) combined with its youth make it an intriguing case study for photoevaporation models, which predict enhanced atmospheric mass loss during early evolutionary stages.},

	abstract = {We use the Robo-AO survey of Kepler planetary candidate host stars, the largest adaptive optics survey yet performed, to measure the recovery rate of close stellar binaries in Gaia DR2. We find that Gaia recovers binaries down to 1" at magnitude contrasts as large as six; closer systems are not resolved, regardless of secondary brightness. Gaia DR2 binary detection does not have a strong dependence on the orientation of the stellar pairs. We find 177 nearby stars to Kepler planetary candidate host stars in Gaia DR2 that were not detected in the Robo-AO survey, almost all of which are faint (G > 20) the remainder were largely targets observed by Robo-AO in poor conditions. If the primary star is the host, the impact on the radii estimates of planet candidates in these systems is likely minimal; many of these faint stars, however, could be faint eclipsing binaries that are the source of a false positive planetary transit signal. With Robo-AO and Gaia combined, we find that 18.7 $\pm$ 0.7% of Kepler planet candidate hosts have nearby stars within 4". We also find 36 nearby stars in Gaia DR2 around 35 planetary candidate host stars detected with K2. The nearby star fraction rate for K2 planetary candidates is significantly lower than that for the primary Kepler mission. The binary recovery rate of Gaia will improve initial radius estimates of future Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite planet candidates significantly; however, ground-based high-resolution follow-up observations are still needed for precise characterization and confirmation. The sensitivity of Gaia to closely separated binaries is expected to improve in later data releases.},

@article{Mann2019a,
	abstract = {The mass--luminosity relation for late-type stars has long been a critical tool for estimating stellar masses. However, there is growing need for both a higher-precision relation and a better understanding of systematic effects (e.g., metallicity). Here we present an empirical relationship between {M}{KS} and M * spanning 0.075 M &sun; < M * < 0.70 M &sun;. The relation is derived from 62 nearby binaries, whose orbits we determine using a combination of Keck/NIRC2 imaging, archival adaptive optics data, and literature astrometry. From their orbital parameters, we determine the total mass of each system, with a precision better than 1% in the best cases. We use these total masses, in combination with resolved K  S  magnitudes and system parallaxes, to calibrate the {M}{KS}--M * relation. The resulting posteriors can be used to determine masses of single stars with a precision of 2%--3%, which we confirm by testing the relation on stars with individual dynamical masses from the literature. The precision is limited by scatter around the best-fit relation beyond measured M * uncertainties, perhaps driven by intrinsic variation in the {M}{KS}--M * relation or underestimated uncertainties in the input parallaxes. We find that the effect of [Fe/H] on the {M}{KS}--M * relation is likely negligible for metallicities in the solar neighborhood (0.0% $\pm$ 2.2% change in mass per dex change in [Fe/H]). This weak effect is consistent with predictions from the Dartmouth Stellar Evolution Database, but inconsistent with those from MESA Isochrones and Stellar Tracks (at 5sigma). A sample of binaries with a wider range of abundances will be required to discern the importance of metallicity in extreme populations (e.g., in the Galactic halo or thick disk).},

	abstract = {We have discovered a new, near-equal-mass, eclipsing M dwarf binary from the Next Generation Transit Survey. This system is only one of three field-age (>1 Gyr), late M dwarf eclipsing binaries known, and has a period of 1.74774 d, similar to that of CM Dra and KOI126. Modelling of the eclipses and radial velocities shows that the component masses are Mpri =0.17391 ^{+0.00153}_{-0.00099} M&sun;, Msec = 0.17418 ^{+0.00193}_{-0.00059} M&sun;; and the radii are Rpri = 0.2045 ^{+0.0038}_{-0.0058} R&sun;, Rsec= 0.2168 ^{+0.0047}_{-0.0048} R&sun;. The effective temperatures are T_pri=2995 ^{+85}_{-105} K and T_sec=2997 ^{+66}_{-101}K, consistent with M5 dwarfs and broadly consistent with main-sequence models. This pair represents a valuable addition that can be used to constrain the mass-radius relationship at the low-mass end of the stellar sequence.},

@article{Mizuki:2018aa,
	abstract = {We report an orbital characterization of GJ1108Aab that is a low-mass binary system in the pre-main-sequence phase. Via the combination of astrometry using adaptive optics and radial velocity measurements, an eccentric orbital solution of e = 0.63 is obtained, which might be induced by the Kozai--Lidov mechanism with a widely separated GJ1108B system. Combined with several observed properties, we confirm that the system is indeed young. Columba is the most probable moving group, to which the GJ1108A system belongs, although its membership to the group has not been established. If the age of Columba is assumed for GJ1108A, the dynamical masses of both GJ1108Aa and GJ1108Ab (M dynamical,GJ1108Aa = 0.72 $\pm$ 0.04 M &sun; and M dynamical,GJ1108Ab = 0.30 $\pm$ 0.03 M &sun;) are more massive than what an evolutionary model predicts based on the age and luminosities. We consider that the discrepancy in mass comparison can be attributed to an age uncertainty; the system is likely older than stars in Columba, and effects that are not implemented in classical models such as accretion history and magnetic activity are not preferred to explain the mass discrepancy. We also discuss the performance of the evolutionary model by compiling similar low-mass objects in the evolutionary state based on the literature. Consequently, it is suggested that the current model on average reproduces the mass of resolved low-mass binaries without any significant offsets.},

	abstract = {M dwarfs are prime targets in the hunt for habitable worlds around other stars. This is due to their abundance as well as their small radii and low masses and temperatures, which facilitate the detection of temperate, rocky planets in orbit around them. However, the fundamental properties of M dwarfs are difficult to constrain, often limiting our ability to characterise the planets they host. Here we test several theoretical relationships for M dwarfs by measuring 23 high precision, model-independent masses and radii for M dwarfs in binaries with white dwarfs. We find a large scatter in the radii of these low-mass stars, with 25 per cent having radii consistent with theoretical models while the rest are up to 12 per cent over-inflated. This scatter is seen in both partially- and fully-convective M dwarfs. No clear trend is seen between the over-inflation and age or metallicity, but there are indications that the radii of slowly rotating M dwarfs are more consistent with predictions, albeit with a similar amount of scatter in the measurements compared to more rapidly rotating M dwarfs. The sample of M dwarfs in close binaries with white dwarfs appears indistinguishable from other M dwarf samples, implying that common envelope evolution has a negligible impact on their structure. We conclude that theoretical and empirical mass-radius relationships lack the precision and accuracy required to measure the fundamental parameters of M dwarfs well enough to determine the internal structure and bulk composition of the planets they host.},

The star is relatively nearby (d = 69 pc) and bright (V = 10.7 mag, K  s  = 8.4 mag), making the planetary system an attractive target for radial velocity follow-up and atmospheric characterization with the James Webb Space Telescope. The inner two planets are hot super-Earths (R  b  = 1.40 $\pm$ 0.06 {R}\oplus , R  c  = 1.34 $\pm$ 0.08 {R}\oplus ), while the outer planet is a warm sub-Neptune (R  d  = 2.6 $\pm$ 0.1 {R}\oplus ). We estimate the stellar age to be {360}-140+490 Myr based on rotation, activity, and kinematic indicators. The K2-233 system is particularly interesting given recent evidence for inflated radii in planets around similarly aged stars, a trend potentially related to photo-evaporation, core cooling, or both mechanisms.},

	abstract = {We report the white light flare rates for 10 ultracool dwarfs using Kepler K2 short-cadence data. Among our sample stars, two have spectral type M6, three are M7, three are M8, and two are L0. Most of our targets are old low-mass stars. We identify a total of 283 flares in all of the stars in our sample, with Kepler energies in the range log E Kp ˜ (29-33.5) erg. Using the maximum-likelihood method of line fitting, we find that the flare frequency distribution (FFD) for each star in our sample follows a power law with slope -alpha in the range -(1.3-2.0). We find that cooler objects tend to have shallower slopes. For some of our targets, the FFD follows either a broken power law, or a power law with an exponential cutoff. For the L0 dwarf 2MASS J12321827-0951502, we find a very shallow slope (-alpha = -1.3) in the Kepler energy range (0.82-130) × 1030 erg: this L0 dwarf has flare rates which are comparable to those of high-energy flares in stars of earlier spectral types. In addition, we report photometry of two superflares: one on the L0 dwarf 2MASS J12321827-0951502 and another on the M7 dwarf 2MASS J08352366+1029318. In the case of 2MASS J12321827-0951502, we report a flare brightening by a factor of ˜144 relative to the quiescent photospheric level. Likewise, for 2MASS J08352366+1029318, we report a flare brightening by a factor of ˜60 relative to the quiescent photospheric level. These two superflares have bolometric (ultraviolet/optical/infrared) energies 3.6 × 1033 erg and 8.9 × 1033 erg respectively, while the full width half maximum timescales are very short, ˜2 min. We find that the M8 star TRAPPIST-1 is more active than the M8.5 dwarf 2M03264453+1919309, but less active than another M8 dwarf (2M12215066-0843197).},

@article{GaiaDr2,
	abstract = {Context. Gaia Data Release 2 (Gaia DR2) contains results for 1693 million sources in the magnitude range 3 to 21 based on observations collected by the European Space Agency Gaia satellite during the first 22 months of its operational phase.  Aims: We describe the input data, models, and processing used for the astrometric content of Gaia DR2, and the validation of these resultsperformed within the astrometry task.  Methods: Some 320 billion centroid positions from the pre-processed astrometric CCD observations were used to estimate the five astrometric parameters (positions, parallaxes, and proper motions) for 1332 million sources, and approximate positions at the reference epoch J2015.5 for an additional 361 million mostly faint sources. These data were calculated in two steps. First, the satellite attitude and the astrometric calibration parameters of the CCDs were obtained in an astrometric global iterative solution for 16 million selected sources, using about 1% of the input data. This primary solution was tied to the extragalactic International Celestial Reference System (ICRS) by means of quasars. The resulting attitude and calibration were then used to calculate the astrometric parameters of all the sources. Special validation solutions were used to characterise the random and systematic errors in parallax and proper motion.  Results: For the sources with five-parameter astrometric solutions, the median uncertainty in parallax and position at the reference epoch J2015.5 is about 0.04 mas for bright (G < 14 mag) sources, 0.1 mas at G = 17 mag, and 0.7 masat G = 20 mag. In the proper motion components the corresponding uncertainties are 0.05, 0.2, and 1.2 mas yr-1, respectively.The optical reference frame defined by Gaia DR2 is aligned with ICRS and is non-rotating with respect to the quasars to within 0.15 mas yr-1. From the quasars and validation solutions we estimate that systematics in the parallaxes depending on position, magnitude, and colour are generally below 0.1 mas, but the parallaxes are on the whole too small by about 0.03 mas. Significant spatial correlations of up to 0.04 mas in parallax and 0.07 mas yr-1 in proper motion are seen on small (< 1 deg) and intermediate (20 deg) angular scales. Important statistics and information for the users of the Gaia DR2 astrometry are given in the appendices.},

@article{Gaia-Collaboration:2018aa,
	abstract = {Context. We present the second Gaia data release, Gaia DR2, consisting of astrometry, photometry, radial velocities, and information on astrophysical parameters and variability, for sources brighter than magnitude 21. In addition epoch astrometry and photometry are provided for a modest sample of minor planets in the solar system.  Aims: A summary of the contents of Gaia DR2 is presented, accompanied by a discussion on the differences with respect to Gaia DR1 and an overview of the main limitations which are still present in the survey. Recommendations are made on the responsible use of Gaia DR2 results.  Methods: The raw data collected with the Gaia instruments during the first 22 months of the mission have been processed by the Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC) and turned into this second data release, which represents a major advance with respect to Gaia DR1 in terms of completeness, performance, and richness of the data products.  Results: Gaia DR2 contains celestial positions and the apparent brightness in G for approximately 1.7 billion sources. For 1.3 billion of those sources, parallaxes and proper motions are in addition available. The sample of sources for which variability information is provided is expanded to 0.5 million stars. This data release contains four new elements: broad-band colour information in the form of the apparent brightness in the GBP (330-680 nm) and GRP (630-1050 nm) bands is available for 1.4 billion sources; median radial velocities for some 7 million sources are presented; for between 77 and 161 million sources estimates are provided of the stellar effective temperature, extinction, reddening, and radius and luminosity; and for a pre-selected list of 14 000 minor planets in the solar system epoch astrometry and photometry are presented. Finally, Gaia DR2 also represents a new materialisation of the celestial reference frame in the optical, the Gaia-CRF2, which is the first optical reference frame based solely on extragalactic sources. There are notable changes in the photometric system and the catalogue source list with respect to Gaia DR1, and we stress the need to consider the two data releases as independent.  Conclusions: Gaia DR2 represents a major achievement for the Gaia mission, delivering on the long standing promise to provide parallaxes and proper motions for over 1 billion stars, and representing a first step in the availability of complementary radial velocity and source astrophysical information for a sample of stars in the Gaia survey which covers a very substantial fraction of the volume of our galaxy.},

@article{Kesseli2018,
	abstract = {Main-sequence, fully convective M dwarfs in eclipsing binaries are observed to be larger than stellar evolutionary models predict by as much as 10%-15%. A proposed explanation for this discrepancy involves effects from strong magnetic fields, induced by rapid rotation via the dynamo process. Although, a handful of single, slowly rotating M dwarfs with radius measurements from interferometry also appear to be larger than models predict, suggesting that rotation or binarity specifically may not be the sole cause of the discrepancy. We test whether single, rapidly rotating, fully convective stars are also larger than expected by measuring their R\sin i distribution. We combine photometric rotation periods from the literature with rotational broadening (v\sin i) measurements reported in this work for a sample of 88 rapidly rotating M dwarf stars. Using a Bayesian framework, we find that stellar evolutionary models underestimate the radii by 10 % {--}15{ % }-2.5+3, but that at higher masses (0.18 < M < 0.4 M Sun), the discrepancy is only about 6% and comparable to results from interferometry and eclipsing binaries. At the lowest masses (0.08 < M < 0.18 M Sun), we find that the discrepancy between observations and theory is 13%-18%, and we argue that the discrepancy is unlikely to be due to effects from age. Furthermore, we find no statistically significant radius discrepancy between our sample and the handful of M dwarfs with interferometric radii. We conclude that neither rotation nor binarity are responsible for the inflated radii of fully convective M dwarfs, and that all fully convective M dwarfs are larger than models predict.},

@article{Stevens:2018aa,
	abstract = {We derive analytic estimates for the ability with which one can obtain precise, empirical stellar masses and radii via single-lined eclipsing binaries (EBs) in the era of Gaia and TESS. Including stars that host transiting substellar companions, such single-lined EBs already number in the hundreds from ground-based transit surveys and will comprise a major component of the science yield from the upcoming TESS mission. We explore the requirements for obtaining a given fractional precision on the masses and radii of single-lined EBs using primarily empirical means: radial velocity and eclipse measurements along with estimates of the primary's (1) surface gravity from high-resolution spectroscopy; (2) radius inferred from parallax, effective temperature, and bolometric flux; or (3) surface gravity and density from asteroseismology. We then compare these requirements to the precision obtained from invoking stellar models or empirical relations. We show that, for a fiducial transiting hot Jupiter system, precise, accurate, and essentially model-independent mass and radius measurements for such single-lined EBs will be possible in the era of Gaia. These will be comparable in precision to those obtained with double-lined EBs. Moreover, the systems for which these methods can be applied will vastly outnumber double-lined EBs, thereby possessing the potential to sample a more complete range of stellar types (such as M dwarfs); these systems will also, in many cases, be more amenable to precision metallicity and abundance determinations than are double-lined EBs.},

@article{Evans:2018aa,
	abstract = {Aims: We describe the photometric content of the second data release of the Gaia project (Gaia DR2) and its validation along with the quality of the data.  Methods: The validation was mainly carried out using an internal analysis of the photometry. External comparisons were also made, but were limited by the precision and systematics that may be present in the external catalogues used.  Results: In addition to the photometric quality assessment, we present the best estimates of the three photometric passbands. Various colour-colour transformations are also derived to enable the users to convert between the Gaia and commonly used passbands.  Conclusions: The internal analysis of the data shows that the photometric calibrations can reach a precision as low as 2 mmag on individual CCD measurements. Other tests show that systematic effects are present in the data at the 10 mmag level.},

	abstract = {The fourth generation of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-IV) has been in operation since 2014 July. This paper describes the second data release from this phase, and the 14th from SDSS overall (making this Data Release Fourteen or DR14). This release makes the data taken by SDSS-IV in its first two years of operation (2014--2016 July) public. Like all previous SDSS releases, DR14 is cumulative, including the most recent reductions and calibrations of all data taken by SDSS since the first phase began operations in 2000. New in DR14 is the first public release of data from the extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey; the first data from the second phase of the Apache Point Observatory (APO) Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE-2), including stellar parameter estimates from an innovative data-driven machine-learning algorithm known as ``The Cannon'' and almost twice as many data cubes from the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at APO (MaNGA) survey as were in the previous release (N = 2812 in total). This paper describes the location and format of the publicly available data from the SDSS-IV surveys. We provide references to the important technical papers describing how these data have been taken (both targeting and observation details) and processed for scientific use. The SDSS web site (www.sdss.org) has been updated for this release and provides links to data downloads, as well as tutorials and examples of data use. SDSS-IV is planning to continue to collect astronomical data until 2020 and will be followed by SDSS-V.},

	abstract = {Precise atmospheric observations have been made for a growing sample of warm Neptunes. Here, we investigate the correlations between these observations and a large number of system parameters to show that, at 95% confidence, the amplitude of a warm Neptune's spectral features in transmission correlates with either its equilibrium temperature (T eq) or its bulk H/He mass fraction (f HHe)---in addition to the standard {kT}/mu g scaling. These correlations could indicate either more optically thick, photochemically produced hazes at lower T eq and/or higher-metallicity atmospheres for planets with smaller radii and lower f HHe. We derive an analytic relation to estimate the observing time needed with JWST/NIRISS to confidently distinguish a nominal gas giant's transmission spectrum from a flat line. Using this tool, we show that these possible atmospheric trends could reduce the number of expected TESS planets accessible to JWST spectroscopy by up to a factor of eight. Additional observations of a larger sample of planets are required to confirm these trends in atmospheric properties as a function of planet or system quantities. If these trends can be confidently identified, the community will be well-positioned to prioritize new targets for atmospheric study and eventually break the complex degeneracies between atmospheric chemistry, composition, and cloud properties.},

	abstract = {Context. Directly imaged planets are ideal candidates for spectroscopic characterization of their atmospheres. The angular separations that are typically close to their host stars, however, reduce the achievable contrast and thus signal-to-noise ratios (S/N).  Aims: We spectroscopically characterize the atmosphere of HD 106906 b, which is a young low-mass companion near the deuterium burning limit. The wide separation from its host star of 7.1'' makes it an ideal candidate for high S/N and high-resolution spectroscopy. We aim to derive new constraints on the spectral type, effective temperature, and luminosity of HD 106906 b and also to provide a high S/N template spectrum for future characterization of extrasolar planets.  Methods: We obtained 1.1-2.5 mum integral field spectroscopy with the VLT/SINFONI instrument with a spectral resolution of R ≈ 2000-4000. New estimates of the parameters of HD 106906 b are derived by analyzing spectral features, comparing the extracted spectra to spectral catalogs of other low-mass objects, and fitting with theoretical isochrones.  Results: We identify several spectral absorption lines that are consistent with a low mass for HD 106906 b. We derive a new spectral type of L1.5 $\pm$ 1.0, which is one subclass earlier than previous estimates. Through comparison with other young low-mass objects, this translates to a luminosity of log(L/L&sun;) = -3.65 $\pm$ 0.08 and an effective temperature of Teff = 1820 $\pm$ 240 K. Our new mass estimates range between M = 11.9-0.8+1.7 MJup (hot start) and M = 14.0-0.5+0.2 MJup (cold start). These limits take into account a possibly finite formation time, i.e., HD 106906 b is allowed to be 0-3 Myr younger than its host star. We exclude accretion onto HD 106906 b at rates M > 4.8 × 10-10 MJup yr-1 based on the fact that we observe no hydrogen (Paschen-beta, Brackett-gamma) emission. This is indicative of little or no circumplanetary gas. With our new observations, HD 106906 b is the planetary-mass object with one of the highest S/N spectra yet. We make the spectrum available for future comparison with data from existing and next-generation (e.g., ELT and JWST) spectrographs.  Fully reduced spectra are only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr (http://130.79.128.5) or via http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/608/A71Based on observations collected at the European Organisation for Astronomical Research in the Southern Hemisphere under ESO programme 094.C-0672(A).},

@article{Rizzuto2017,
	abstract = {Detection of transiting exoplanets around young stars is more difficult than for older systems owing to increased stellar variability. Nine young open cluster planets have been found in the K2 data, but no single analysis pipeline identified all planets. We have developed a transit search pipeline for young stars that uses a transit-shaped notch and quadratic continuum in a 12 or 24 hr window to fit both the stellar variability and the presence of a transit. In addition, for the most rapid rotators ({P}{rot}< 2 days) we model the variability using a linear combination of observed rotations of each star. To maximally exploit our new pipeline, we update the membership for four stellar populations observed by K2 (Upper Scorpius, Pleiades, Hyades, Praesepe) and conduct a uniform search of the members. We identify all known transiting exoplanets in the clusters, 17 eclipsing binaries, one transiting planet candidate orbiting a potential Pleiades member, and three orbiting unlikely members of the young clusters. Limited injection recovery testing on the known planet hosts indicates that for the older Praesepe systems we are sensitive to additional exoplanets as small as 1-2 R ⊕, and for the larger Upper Scorpius planet host (K2-33) our pipeline is sensitive to ˜4 R ⊕ transiting planets. The lack of detected multiple systems in the young clusters is consistent with the expected frequency from the original Kepler sample, within our detection limits. With a robust pipeline that detects all known planets in the young clusters, occurrence rate testing at young ages is now possible.},

	abstract = {We report the discovery of a Neptune-size planet ({R}{{p}}=3.0 {R}\oplus ) in the Hyades Cluster. The host star is in a binary system, comprising a K5V star and M7/8V star with a projected separation of 40 au. The planet orbits the primary star with an orbital period of 17.3 days and a transit duration of 3 hrs. The host star is bright (V = 11.2, J = 9.1) and so may be a good target for precise radial velocity measurements. K2-136A c is the first Neptune-sized planet to be found orbiting in a binary system within an open cluster. The Hyades is the nearest star cluster to the Sun, has an age of 625--750 Myr, and forms one of the fundamental rungs in the distance ladder; understanding the planet population in such a well-studied cluster can help us understand and set constraints on the formation and evolution of planetary systems.},

The planets have orbital periods of 7.9757 $\pm$ 0.0011, {17.30681}-0.00036+0.00034, and {25.5715}-0.0040+0.0038 {days}, and radii of 1.05 $\pm$ 0.16, 3.14 $\pm$ 0.36, and {1.55}-0.21+0.24 {R}\oplus , respectively. With an age of 600--800 Myr, these planets are some of the smallest and youngest transiting planets known. Due to the relatively bright (J = 9.1) host star, the planets are compelling targets for future characterization via radial velocity mass measurements and transmission spectroscopy. As the first known star with multiple transiting planets in a cluster, the system should be helpful for testing theories of planet formation and migration.},

In this work, we show that the LDB method can be extended to significant older ages than previously thought. Intermediate resolution optical spectra of six L-type candidate members in the Hyades cluster obtained using Optical System for Imaging and Low Resolution Integrated Spectroscopy at the 10.4 m Gran Telescopio Canarias are presented. The {Li} {{I}} 670.8 nm resonance doublet is clearly detected only in the two faintest and coolest of these objects, which are classified as L3.5 to L4 brown dwarf (BD) cluster members with luminosities around 10-4 solar. Lithium depletion factors are estimated for our targets with the aid of synthetic spectra and they are compared with predictions from evolutionary models. An LDB age of 650 $\pm$ 70 Myr for the Hyades provides a consistent description of our data using a set of state-of-the-art evolutionary models for BDs calculated by Baraffe et al.

@article{Gillen2017a,
	abstract = {We present the discovery and characterization of four low-mass (M< 0.6 {M}o ) eclipsing binary (EB) systems in the sub-Gyr old Praesepe open cluster using Kepler/K2 time series photometry and Keck/HIRES spectroscopy. We present a new Gaussian process EB model, GP--EBOP, as well as a method of simultaneously determining effective temperatures and distances for EBs. Three of the reported systems (AD 3814, AD 2615 and AD 1508) are detached and double-lined, and precise solutions are presented for the first two. We determine masses and radii to 1%--3% precision for AD 3814 and to 5%--6% for AD 2615. Together with effective temperatures determined to ~50 K precision, we test the PARSEC v1.2 and BHAC15 stellar evolution models. Our EB parameters are more consistent with the PARSEC models, primarily because the BHAC15 temperature scale is hotter than our data over the mid-M-dwarf mass range probed. Both ADs 3814 and 2615, which have orbital periods of 6.0 and 11.6 days, are circularized but not synchronized. This suggests that either synchronization proceeds more slowly in fully convective stars than the theory of equilibrium tides predicts, or magnetic braking is currently playing a more important role than tidal forces in the spin evolution of these binaries. The fourth system (AD 3116) comprises a brown dwarf transiting a mid-M-dwarf, which is the first such system discovered in a sub-Gyr open cluster. Finally, these new discoveries increase the number of characterized EBs in sub-Gyr open clusters by 20% (40%) below M< 1.5 M &sun; (M< 0.6 M &sun;).},

We identify 17 new examples of young, probably single stars with ages of <200 Myr and provide additional evidence for a new Northern hemisphere kinematic association: the Pisces moving group (MG). The group consists of 14 lithium-rich G- and K-type stars that have a dispersion of only ˜3 km s-1 in each Galactic space velocity coordinate. The group members are approximately coeval in the colour-magnitude diagram, with an age of 30-50 Myr, and have similar, though not identical, kinematics to the Octans-Near MG.},

	abstract = {The prospects for the habitability of M-dwarf planets have long been debated, due to key differences between the unique stellar and planetary environments around these low-mass stars, as compared to hotter, more luminous Sun-like stars. Over the past decade, significant progress has been made by both space- and ground-based observatories to measure the likelihood of small planets to orbit in the habitable zones of M-dwarf stars. We now know that most M dwarfs are hosts to closely-packed planetary systems characterized by a paucity of Jupiter-mass planets and the presence of multiple rocky planets, with roughly a third of these rocky M-dwarf planets orbiting within the habitable zone, where they have the potential to support liquid water on their surfaces. Theoretical studies have also quantified the effect on climate and habitability of the interaction between the spectral energy distribution of M-dwarf stars and the atmospheres and surfaces of their planets. These and other recent results fill in knowledge gaps that existed at the time of the previous overview papers published nearly a decade ago by Tarter et al. (2007) and Scalo et al. (2007). In this review we provide a comprehensive picture of the current knowledge of M-dwarf planet occurrence and habitability based on work done in this area over the past decade, and summarize future directions planned in this quickly evolving field.},

@article{Bowler:2017aa,
	abstract = {ROXs 12 (2MASS J16262803-2526477) is a young star hosting a directly imaged companion near the deuterium-burning limit. We present a suite of spectroscopic, imaging, and time-series observations to characterize the physical and environmental properties of this system. Moderate-resolution near-infrared spectroscopy of ROXs 12 B from Gemini-North/NIFS and Keck/OSIRIS reveals signatures of low surface gravity including weak alkali absorption lines and a triangular H-band pseudocontinuum shape. No signs of Pabeta emission are evident. As a population, however, we find that about half (46% $\pm$ 14%) of young (≲15 Myr) companions with masses ≲20 M Jup possess actively accreting subdisks detected via Pabeta line emission, which represents a lower limit on the prevalence of circumplanetary disks in general, as some are expected to be in a quiescent phase of accretion. The bolometric luminosity of the companion and age of the host star ({6}-2+4 Myr) imply a mass of 17.5 $\pm$ 1.5 M Jup for ROXs 12 B based on hot-start evolutionary models. We identify a wide (5100 au) tertiary companion to this system, 2MASS J16262774-2527247, that is heavily accreting and exhibits stochastic variability in its K2 light curve. By combining v sin i * measurements with rotation periods from K2, we constrain the line-of-sight inclinations of ROXs 12 A and 2MASS J16262774-2527247 and find that they are misaligned by {{60}-11+7}^\circ . In addition, the orbital axis of ROXs 12 B is likely misaligned from the spin axis of its host star, ROXs 12 A, suggesting that ROXs 12 B formed akin to fragmenting binary stars or in an equatorial disk that was torqued by the wide stellar tertiary.  Some of the data presented herein were obtained at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated as a scientific partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of California, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The observatory was made possible by the generous financial support of the W. M. Keck Foundation.},

@article{Oshagh:2017aa,
	abstract = {One of the best ways to improve our understanding of the stellar activity-induced signal in radial velocity (RV) measurements is through simultaneous high-precision photometric and RV observations. This is of prime importance to mitigate the RV signal induced by stellar activity and therefore unveil the presence of low-mass exoplanets. The K2 Campaign 7 and 8 fields of view were located in the southern hemisphere, and provided a unique opportunity to gather unprecedented simultaneous high-precision photometric observation with K2 and high-precision RV measurements with the HARPS spectrograph to study the relationship between photometric variability and RV jitter. We observed nine stars with different levels of activity, from quiet to very active. We first probed the presence of any meaningful relation between measured RV jitter and the simultaneous photometric variation, and also other activity indicators (such as BIS, FWHM, log R'HK, and F8) by evaluating the strength and significance of the monotonic correlation between RVs and each indicator. We found that for the case of very active stars, strong and significant correlations exist between almost all the observables and measured RVs; however, when we move towards lower activity levels the correlations become random, and we could not reach any conclusion regarding the tendency of correlations depending on the stellar activity level. Except for the F8 whose strong correlation with RV jitter persists over a wide range of stellar activity level, and thus our result suggests that F8 might be a powerful proxy for activity-induced RV jitter over a wide range of stellar activity. Moreover, we examine the capability of two state-of-the-art modeling techniques, namely the FF' method and SOAP2.0, to accurately predict the RV jitter amplitude using the simultaneous photometric observation. We found that for the very active stars both techniques can predict the amplitude of the RV jitter reasonably well; however, at lower activity levels the FF' method underpredicts the RV jitter amplitude.  RV measurements obtained from the HARPS pipeline are only available in electronic form at the CDS via anonymous ftp to http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr (http://130.79.128.5) or via http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/606/A107},

@article{Vorobyov:2017aa,
	abstract = {Aims: The pre-main-sequence evolution of low-mass stars and brown dwarfs is studied numerically starting from the formation of a protostellar or proto-brown dwarf seed and taking into account the mass accretion onto the central object during the initial several Myr of evolution.  Methods: The stellar evolution was computed using the STELLAR evolution code with recent modifications. The mass accretion rates were taken from numerical hydrodynamics models by computing the circumstellar disk evolution starting from the gravitational collapse of prestellar cloud cores of various mass and angular momentum. The resulting stellar evolution tracks were compared with the isochrones and isomasses calculated using non-accreting models.  Results: We find that mass accretion in the initial several Myr of protostellar evolution can have a strong effect on the subsequent evolution of young stars and brown dwarfs. The disagreement between accreting and non-accreting models in terms of the total stellar luminosity L*, stellar radius R*, and effective temperature Teff depends on the thermal efficiency of accretion, that is, on the fraction of accretion energy that is absorbed by the central object. The largest mismatch is found for the cold accretion case, in which essentially all accretion energy is radiated away. The relative deviations in L* and R* in this case can reach 50% for objects 1.0 Myr old, and they remain notable even for objects 10 Myr old. In the hot and hybrid accretion cases, in which a constant fraction of accretion energy is absorbed, the disagreement between accreting and non-accreting models becomes less pronounced, but still remains notable for objects 1.0 Myr old. These disagreements may lead to an incorrect age estimate for objects of (sub-)solar mass when using the isochrones that are based on non-accreting models, as has also been noted previously. We find that objects with strong luminosity bursts exhibit notable excursions in the L*-Teff diagram, but the character of these excursions is distinct for hybrid or hot and cold accretion scenarios. In particular, the cold accretion scenario predicts peak luminosities that are greater than those of known FU Orionis-type outbursts, which implies that cold accretion is physically less realistic.  Conclusions: Mass accretion during the early stages of star and brown dwarf evolution is an important factor, but its effect depends on the details of how the accreted energy can further be distributed within the star. Efforts should now be made to better understand the character of accretion in young protostellar objects.},

	abstract = {We conduct a uniform analysis of the transit timing variations (TTVs) of 145 planets from 55 Kepler multiplanet systems to infer planet masses and eccentricities. Eighty of these planets do not have previously reported mass and eccentricity measurements. We employ two complementary methods to fit TTVs: Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations based on N-body integration, and an analytic fitting approach. Mass measurements of 49 planets, including 12 without previously reported masses, meet our criterion for classification as robust. Using mass and radius measurements, we infer the masses of planets' gaseous envelopes for both our TTV sample and transiting planets with radial velocity observations. Insight from analytic TTV formulae allows us to partially circumvent degeneracies inherent to inferring eccentricities from TTV observations. We find that planet eccentricities are generally small, typically a few percent, but in many instances are nonzero.},

	abstract = {We explore the multiplicity of exoplanet host stars with high-resolution images obtained with VLT/SPHERE. Two different samples of systems were observed: one containing low-eccentricity outer planets, and the other containing high-eccentricity outer planets. We find that 10 out of 34 stars in the high-eccentricity systems are members of a binary, while the proportion is 3 out of 27 for circular systems. Eccentric-exoplanet hosts are, therefore, significantly more likely to have a stellar companion than circular-exoplanet hosts. The median magnitude contrast over the 68 data sets is 11.26 and 9.25, in H and K, respectively, at 0.30 arcsec. The derived detection limits reveal that binaries with separations of less than 50 au are rarer for exoplanet hosts than for field stars. Our results also imply that the majority of high-eccentricity planets are not embedded in multiple stellar systems (24 out of 34), since our detection limits exclude the presence of a stellar companion. We detect the low-mass stellar companions of HD 7449 and HD 211847, both members of our high-eccentricity sample. HD 7449B was already detected and our independent observation is in agreement with this earlier work. HD 211847's substellar companion, previously detected by the radial velocity method, is actually a low-mass star seen face-on. The role of stellar multiplicity in shaping planetary systems is confirmed by this work, although it does not appear as the only source of dynamical excitation.

@article{Dupuy2017,
	abstract = {We present the full results of our decade-long astrometric monitoring programs targeting 31 ultracool binaries with component spectral types M7-T5. Joint analysis of resolved imaging from Keck Observatory and Hubble Space Telescope and unresolved astrometry from CFHT/WIRCam yields parallactic distances for all systems, robust orbit determinations for 23 systems, and photocenter orbits for 19 systems. As a result, we measure 38 precise individual masses spanning 30-115 {M}{Jup}. We determine a model-independent substellar boundary that is ≈70 {M}{Jup} in mass (≈L4 in spectral type), and we validate Baraffe et al. evolutionary model predictions for the lithium-depletion boundary (60 {M}{Jup} at field ages). Assuming each binary is coeval, we test models of the substellar mass-luminosity relation and find that in the L/T transition, only the Saumon & Marley ``hybrid'' models accounting for cloud clearing match our data. We derive a precise, mass-calibrated spectral type-effective temperature relation covering 1100-2800 K. Our masses enable a novel direct determination of the age distribution of field brown dwarfs spanning L4-T5 and 30-70 {M}{Jup}. We determine a median age of 1.3 Gyr, and our population synthesis modeling indicates our sample is consistent with a constant star formation history modulated by dynamical heating in the Galactic disk. We discover two triple-brown-dwarf systems, the first with directly measured masses and eccentricities. We examine the eccentricity distribution, carefully considering biases and completeness, and find that low-eccentricity orbits are significantly more common among ultracool binaries than solar-type binaries, possibly indicating the early influence of long-lived dissipative gas disks. Overall, this work represents a major advance in the empirical view of very low-mass stars and brown dwarfs.},

@article{Mann2017b,
	abstract = {We report parallaxes and proper motions from the Hawaii Infrared Parallax Program for eight nearby M dwarf stars with transiting exoplanets discovered by Kepler. We combine our directly measured distances with mass-luminosity and radius-luminosity relationships to significantly improve constraints on the host stars' properties. Our astrometry enables the identification of wide stellar companions to the planet hosts. Within our limited sample, all the multi-transiting planet hosts (three of three) appear to be single stars, while nearly all (four of five) of the systems with a single detected planet have wide stellar companions. By applying strict priors on average stellar density from our updated radius and mass in our transit fitting analysis, we measure the eccentricity probability distributions for each transiting planet. Planets in single-star systems tend to have smaller eccentricities than those in binaries, although this difference is not significant in our small sample. In the case of Kepler-42bcd, where the eccentricities are known to be ~=0, we demonstrate that such systems can serve as powerful tests of M dwarf evolutionary models by working in {L}\star {--}{rho }\star  space. The transit-fit density for Kepler-42bcd is inconsistent with model predictions at 2.1sigma (22%), but matches more empirical estimates at 0.2sigma (2%), consistent with earlier results showing model radii of M dwarfs are underinflated. Gaia will provide high-precision parallaxes for the entire Kepler M dwarf sample, and the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite will identify more planets transiting nearby, late-type stars, enabling significant improvements in our understanding of the eccentricity distribution of small planets and the parameters of late-type dwarfs.},

@article{Beatty:2017aa,
	abstract = {Using the Spitzer Space Telescope, we observed a transit at 3.6 mum of KELT-11b. We also observed three partial planetary transits from the ground. We simultaneously fit these observations, ground-based photometry from Pepper et al., radial velocity data from Pepper et al., and a spectral energy distribution (SED) model using catalog magnitudes and the Hipparcos parallax to the system. The only significant difference between our results and those of Pepper et al. is that we find the orbital period to be shorter by 37 s, 4.73610 $\pm$ 0.00003 versus 4.73653 $\pm$ 0.00006 days, and we measure a transit center time of {{BJD}}{TDB} 2457483.4310 $\pm$ 0.0007, which is 42 minutes earlier than predicted. Using our new photometry, we precisely measure the density of the star KELT-11 to 4%. By combining the parallax and catalog magnitudes of the system, we are able to measure the radius of KELT-11b essentially empirically. Coupled with the stellar density, this gives a parallactic mass and radius of 1.8 {M}&sun;  and 2.9 {R}&sun; , which are each approximately 1sigma higher than the adopted model-estimated mass and radius. If we conduct the same fit using the expected parallax uncertainty from the final Gaia data release, this difference increases to 4sigma. The differences between the model and parallactic masses and radii for KELT-11 demonstrate the role that precise Gaia parallaxes, coupled with simultaneous photometric, radial velocity, and SED fitting, can play in determining stellar and planetary parameters. With high-precision photometry of transiting planets and high-precision Gaia parallaxes, the parallactic mass and radius uncertainties of stars become 1% and 3%, respectively. TESS is expected to discover 60-80 systems where these measurements will be possible. These parallactic mass and radius measurements have uncertainties small enough that they may provide observational input into the stellar models themselves.},

@article{Nelson:2017aa,
	abstract = {Disk migration and high-eccentricity migration are two well-studied theories to explain the formation of hot Jupiters. The former predicts that these planets can migrate up until the planet-star Roche separation ({a}{Roche}) and the latter predicts they will tidally circularize at a minimum distance of 2 {a}{Roche}. Considering long-running radial velocity and transit surveys have identified a couple hundred hot Jupiters to date, we can revisit the classic question of hot-Jupiter formation in a data-driven manner. We approach this problem using data from several exoplanet surveys (radial velocity, Kepler, HAT, and WASP) allowing for either a single population or a mixture of populations associated with these formation channels, and applying a hierarchical Bayesian mixture model of truncated power laws of the form {x}gamma -1 to constrain the population-level parameters of interest (e.g., location of inner edges, gamma, mixture fractions). Within the limitations of our chosen models, we find that the current radial velocity and Kepler sample of hot Jupiters can be well explained with a single truncated power-law distribution with a lower cutoff near 2 {a}{Roche}, a result that still holds after a decade, and gamma =-0.51{+/- }0.200.19. However, the HAT and WASP data show evidence for multiple populations (Bayes factor ≈ {10}21). We find that 15{+/- }69 %  reside in a component consistent with disk migration (gamma =-0.04{+/- }1.270.53) and 85{+/- }96 %  in one consistent with high-eccentricity migration (gamma =-1.38{+/- }0.470.32). We find no immediately strong connections with some observed host star properties and speculate on how future exoplanet surveys could improve upon hot-Jupiter population inference.},

	abstract = {We report the discovery of a multi-planet system orbiting HD 106315, a rapidly rotating mid F-type star, using data from the K2 mission. HD 106315 hosts a 2.51 $\pm$ 0.12 R ⊕ sub-Neptune in a 9.5-day orbit and a {4.31}-0.27+0.24 {R}\oplus  super-Neptune in a 21-day orbit. The projected rotational velocity of HD 106315 (12.9 km s-1) likely precludes precise measurements of the planets' masses but could enable a measurement of the sky-projected spin-orbit obliquity for the outer planet via Doppler tomography. The eccentricities of both planets were constrained to be consistent with 0, following a global modeling of the system that includes a Gaia distance and dynamical arguments. The HD 106315 system is one of few multi-planet systems hosting a Neptune-sized planet for which orbital obliquity measurements are possible, making it an excellent test-case for formation mechanisms of warm-Neptunian systems. The brightness of the host star also makes HD 106315 c a candidate for future transmission spectroscopic follow-up studies.},

	abstract = {We present a mass-luminosity relation (MLR) for red dwarfs spanning a range of masses from 0.62 {{ M }}&sun;  to the end of the stellar main sequence at 0.08 {{ M }}&sun; . The relation is based on 47 stars for which dynamical masses have been determined, primarily using astrometric data from Fine Guidance Sensors (FGS) 3 and 1r, white-light interferometers on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), and radial velocity data from McDonald Observatory. For our HST/FGS sample of 15 binaries, component mass errors range from 0.4% to 4.0% with a median error of 1.8%. With these and masses from other sources, we construct a V-band MLR for the lower main sequence with 47 stars and a K-band MLR with 45 stars with fit residuals half of those of the V band. We use GJ 831 AB as an example, obtaining an absolute trigonometric parallax, pi abs = 125.3 $\pm$ 0.3 mas, with orbital elements yielding {{ M }}{{A}}=0.270+/- 0.004 {{ M }}&sun;  and {{ M }}{{B}}=0.145+/- 0.002 {{ M }}&sun; . The mass precision rivals that derived for eclipsing binaries. A remaining major task is the interpretation of the intrinsic cosmic scatter in the observed MLR for low-mass stars in terms of physical effects. In the meantime, useful mass values can be estimated from the MLR for the ubiquitous red dwarfs that account for 75% of all stars, with applications ranging from the characterization of exoplanet host stars to the contribution of red dwarfs to the mass of the universe.  Based on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS5-26555.},

@article{Martinez:2017aa,
	abstract = {The NASA K2 mission uses photometry to find planets transiting stars of various types. M dwarfs are of high interest since they host more short-period planets than any other type of main-sequence star and transiting planets around M dwarfs have deeper transits compared to other main-sequence stars. In this paper, we present stellar parameters from K and M dwarfs hosting transiting planet candidates discovered by our team. Using the SOFI spectrograph on the European Southern Observatory's New Technology Telescope, we obtained R ≈ 1000 J-, H-, and K-band (0.95-2.52 mum) spectra of 34 late-type K2 planet and candidate planet host systems and 12 bright K4-M5 dwarfs with interferometrically measured radii and effective temperatures. Out of our 34 late-type K2 targets, we identify 27 of these stars as M dwarfs. We measure equivalent widths of spectral features, derive calibration relations using stars with interferometric measurements, and estimate stellar radii, effective temperatures, masses, and luminosities for the K2 planet hosts. Our calibrations provide radii and temperatures with median uncertainties of 0.059 R &sun; (16.09%) and 160 K (4.33%), respectively. We then reassess the radii and equilibrium temperatures of known and candidate planets based on our spectroscopically derived stellar parameters. Since a planet's radius and equilibrium temperature depend on the parameters of its host star, our study provides more precise planetary parameters for planets and candidates orbiting late-type stars observed with K2. We find a median planet radius and an equilibrium temperature of approximately 3 R ⊕ and 500 K, respectively, with several systems (K2-18b and K2-72e) receiving near-Earth-like levels of incident irradiation.},

@article{Gully-Santiago2017,
	abstract = {Ages and masses of young stars are often estimated by comparing their luminosities and effective temperatures to pre-main-sequence stellar evolution tracks, but magnetic fields and starspots complicate both the observations and evolution. To understand their influence, we study the heavily spotted weak-lined T-Tauri star LkCa 4 by searching for spectral signatures of radiation originating from the starspot or starspot groups. We introduce a new methodology for constraining both the starspot filling factor and the spot temperature by fitting two-temperature stellar atmosphere models constructed from Phoenix synthetic spectra to a high-resolution near-IR IGRINS spectrum. Clearly discernable spectral features arise from both a hot photospheric component {T}{hot} ~ 4100 K and a cool component {T}{cool} ~ 2700--3000 K, which covers ~80% of the visible surface. This mix of hot and cool emission is supported by analyses of the spectral energy distribution, rotational modulation of colors and of TiO band strengths, and features in low-resolution optical/near-IR spectroscopy. Although the revised effective temperature and luminosity make LkCa 4 appear to be much younger and of much lower mass than previous estimates from unspotted stellar evolution models, appropriate estimates will require the production and adoption of spotted evolutionary models. Biases from starspots likely afflict most fully convective young stars and contribute to uncertainties in ages and age spreads of open clusters. In some spectral regions, starspots act as a featureless ``veiling'' continuum owing to high rotational broadening and heavy line blanketing in cool star spectra. Some evidence is also found for an anticorrelation between the velocities of the warm and cool components.},

@article{Somers2017,
	abstract = {Precise measurements of eclipsing binary parameters and statistical studies of young clusters have suggested that some magnetically active low-mass dwarfs possess radii inflated by ~5%--15% relative to theoretical expectations. If true, this effect should be pronounced in young open clusters, due to the rapid rotation and strong magnetic activity of their most extreme members. We explore this possibility by determining empirical radii for 83 members of the nearby Pleiades open cluster, using spectral energy distribution fitting to establish {{ F }}{bol} with a typical accuracy of ≈3% together with color and spectro-photometric indices to determine {T}{eff}. We find several Pleiades members with radii inflated above radius-{T}{eff} models from state-of-the-art calculations, and apparent dispersions in radii for the K-dwarfs of the cluster. Moreover, we demonstrate that this putative radius inflation correlates strongly with rotation rate, consistent with inflation of young stars by magnetic activity and/or starspots. We argue that this signal is not a consequence of starspot-induced color anomalies, binarity, or depth effects in the cluster, employing Gaia DR1 distances as a check. Finally, we consider the lithium abundances of these stars, demonstrating a triple correlation between rotation rate, radius inflation, and enhanced lithium abundance. Our result---already significant to ~99.99% confidence---provides strong support for a magnetic origin of the inflated radii and lithium dispersion observed in young, low-mass stars.},

@article{Kane2017,
	abstract = {A critical component of exoplanetary studies is an exhaustive characterization of the host star, from which the planetary properties are frequently derived. Of particular value are the radius, temperature, and luminosity, which are key stellar parameters for studies of transit and habitability science. Here we present the results of new observations of Wolf 1061, known to host three super-Earths. Our observations from the Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy interferometric array provide a direct stellar radius measurement of 0.3207 $\pm$ 0.0088 R&sun;, from which we calculate the effective temperature and luminosity using spectral energy distribution models. We obtained 7 yr of precise, automated photometry that reveals the correct stellar rotation period of 89.3 $\pm$ 1.8 days, finds no evidence of photometric transits, and confirms that the radial velocity signals are not due to stellar activity. Finally, our stellar properties are used to calculate the extent of the Habitable Zone (HZ) for the Wolf 1061 system, for which the optimistic boundaries are 0.09--0.23 au. Our simulations of the planetary orbital dynamics show that the eccentricity of the HZ planet oscillates to values as high as ~0.15 as it exchanges angular momentum with the other planets in the system.},

The goal of the survey was to characterize planets orbiting low-mass stars, but our Infrared Telescope Facility/SpeX and Palomar/TripleSpec spectroscopic observations revealed that 49% of our targets were actually giant stars or hotter dwarfs reddened by interstellar extinction. For the 72 stars with spectra consistent with classification as cool dwarfs (spectral types K3--M4), we refined their stellar properties by applying empirical relations based on stars with interferometric radius measurements. Although our revised temperatures are generally consistent with those reported in the Ecliptic Plane Input Catalog (EPIC), our revised stellar radii are typically 0.13 {R}o  (39%) larger than the EPIC values, which were based on model isochrones that have been shown to underestimate the radii of cool dwarfs. Our improved stellar characterizations will enable more efficient prioritization of K2 targets for follow-up studies.},

	abstract = {Open clusters and young stellar associations are attractive sites to search for planets and to test theories of planet formation, migration, and evolution. We present our search for, and characterization of, transiting planets in the 800 Myr old Praesepe (Beehive, M44) Cluster from K2 light curves. We identify seven planet candidates, six of which we statistically validate to be real planets, the last of which requires more data. For each host star, we obtain high-resolution NIR spectra to measure its projected rotational broadening and radial velocity, the latter of which we use to confirm cluster membership. We combine low-resolution spectra with the known cluster distance and metallicity to provide precise temperatures, masses, radii, and luminosities for the host stars. Combining our measurements of rotational broadening, rotation periods, and our derived stellar radii, we show that all planetary orbits are consistent with alignment to their host star's rotation. We fit the K2 light curves, including priors on stellar density to put constraints on the planetary eccentricities, all of which are consistent with zero. The difference between the number of planets found in Praesepe and Hyades (8 planets, ~= 800 Myr) and a similar data set for Pleiades (0 planets, ~=125 Myr) suggests a trend with age, but may be due to incompleteness of current search pipelines for younger, faster-rotating stars. We see increasing evidence that some planets continue to lose atmosphere past 800 Myr, as now two planets at this age have radii significantly larger than their older counterparts from Kepler.},

	abstract = {We report results of an extended spectropolarimetric and photometric monitoring of the weak-line T Tauri star V830 Tau and its recently-detected newborn close-in giant planet. Our observations, carried out within the MaTYSSE programme, were spread over 91d, and involved the ESPaDOnS and Narval spectropolarimeters linked to the 3.6m Canada-France-Hawaii, the 2m Bernard Lyot and the 8-m Gemini-North Telescopes. Using Zeeman-Doppler Imaging, we characterize the surface brightness distributions, magnetic topologies and surface differential rotation of V830 Tau at the time of our observations, and demonstrate that both distributions evolve with time beyond what is expected from differential rotation. We also report that near the end of our observations, V830 Tau triggered one major flare and two weaker precursors, showing up as enhanced red-shifted emission in multiple spectral activity proxies. With 3 different filtering techniques, we model the radial velocity (RV) activity jitter (of semi-amplitude 1.2km/s) that V830 Tau generates, successfully retrieve the 68m/s RV planet signal hiding behind the jitter, further confirm the existence of V830 Tau b and better characterize its orbital parameters. We find that the method based on Gaussian-process regression performs best thanks to its higher ability at modelling not only the activity jitter, but also its temporal evolution over the course of our observations, and succeeds at reproducing our RV data down to a rms precision of 35m/s. Our result provides new observational constraints on scenarios of star / planet formation and demonstrates the scientific potential of large-scale searches for close-in giant planets around T Tauri stars.},

	abstract = {Open clusters have been the focus of several exoplanet surveys, but only a few planets have so far been discovered. The Kepler spacecraft revealed an abundance of small planets around small cool stars, therefore, such cluster members are prime targets for exoplanet transit searches. Kepler's new mission, K2, is targeting several open clusters and star-forming regions around the ecliptic to search for transiting planets around their low-mass constituents. Here, we report the discovery of the first transiting planet in the intermediate-age (800 Myr) Beehive cluster (Praesepe). K2-95 is a faint (K{{p}}=15.5 {mag}) {{M}}3.0+/- 0.5 dwarf from K2's Campaign 5 with an effective temperature of 3471+/- 124 {{K}}, approximately solar metallicity and a radius of 0.402+/- 0.050  {R}&sun; . We detected a transiting planet with a radius of {3.47}-0.53+0.78 {R}\oplus  and an orbital period of 10.134 days. We combined photometry, medium/high-resolution spectroscopy, adaptive optics/speckle imaging, and archival survey images to rule out any false-positive detection scenarios, validate the planet, and further characterize the system. The planet's radius is very unusual as M-dwarf field stars rarely have Neptune-sized transiting planets. The comparatively large radius of K2-95b is consistent with the other recently discovered cluster planets K2-25b (Hyades) and K2-33b (Upper Scorpius), indicating systematic differences in their evolutionary states or formation. These discoveries from K2 provide a snapshot of planet formation and evolution in cluster environments and thus make excellent laboratories to test differences between field-star and cluster planet populations.},

	abstract = {We are developing a stable and precise spectrograph for the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT) named "iLocater." The instrument comprises three principal components: a cross-dispersed echelle spectrograph that operates in the YJ-bands (0.97-1.30 mum), a fiber-injection acquisition camera system, and a wavelength calibration unit. iLocater will deliver high spectral resolution (R 150,000-240,000) measurements that permit novel studies of stellar and substellar objects in the solar neighborhood including extrasolar planets. Unlike previous planet-finding instruments, which are seeing-limited, iLocater operates at the diffraction limit and uses single mode fibers to eliminate the effects of modal noise entirely. By receiving starlight from two 8.4m diameter telescopes that each use "extreme" adaptive optics (AO), iLocater shows promise to overcome the limitations that prevent existing instruments from generating sub-meter-per-second radial velocity (RV) precision. Although optimized for the characterization of low-mass planets using the Doppler technique, iLocater will also advance areas of research that involve crowded fields, line-blanketing, and weak absorption lines.},

	abstract = {Strongly irradiated giant planets are observed to have radii larger than thermal evolution models predict. Although these inflated planets have been known for over 15 years, it is unclear whether their inflation is caused by the deposition of energy from the host star or the inhibited cooling of the planet. These processes can be distinguished if the planet becomes highly irradiated only when the host star evolves onto the red giant branch. We report the discovery of K2-97b, a 1.31 $\pm$ 0.11 R J, 1.10 $\pm$ 0.11 M J planet orbiting a 4.20 $\pm$ 0.14 R &sun;, 1.16 $\pm$ 0.12 M &sun; red giant star with an orbital period of 8.4 days. We precisely constrained stellar and planetary parameters by combining asteroseismology, spectroscopy, and granulation noise modeling along with transit and radial velocity measurements. The uncertainty in planet radius is dominated by systematic differences in transit depth, which we measure to be up to 30% between different light-curve reduction methods. Our calculations indicate the incident flux on this planet was {170}-60+140 times the incident flux on Earth, while the star was on the main sequence. Previous studies suggest that this incident flux is insufficient to delay planetary cooling enough to explain the present planet radius. This system thus provides the first evidence that planets may be inflated directly by incident stellar radiation rather than by delayed loss of heat from formation. Further studies of planets around red giant branch stars will confirm or contradict this hypothesis and may reveal a new class of re-inflated planets.},

	abstract = {Hot Jupiters, giant extrasolar planets with orbital periods shorter than ˜10 days, have long been thought to form at large radial distances, only to subsequently experience long-range inward migration. Here, we offer the contrasting view that a substantial fraction of the hot Jupiter population formed in situ via the core-accretion process. We show that under conditions appropriate to the inner regions of protoplanetary disks, rapid gas accretion can be initiated by super-Earth-type planets, comprising 10-20 Earth masses of refractory material. An in situ formation scenario leads to testable consequences, including the expectation that hot Jupiters should frequently be accompanied by additional low-mass planets with periods shorter than ˜100 days. Our calculations further demonstrate that dynamical interactions during the early stages of planetary systems' lifetimes should increase the inclinations of such companions, rendering transits rare. High-precision radial velocity monitoring provides the best prospect for their detection.},

@article{Feiden2016,
	abstract = {When determining absolute ages of identifiably young stellar populations, results strongly depend on which stars are studied. Cooler (K, M) stars typically yield ages that are systematically younger than warmer (A, F, G) stars by a factor of two. I explore the possibility that these age discrepancies are the result of magnetic inhibition of convection in cool young stars by using magnetic stellar evolution isochrones to determine the median age of the Upper Scorpius subgroup of the Scorpius-Centaurus OB association. A median age of 10 Myr consistent across spectral types A through M is found, except for a subset of F-type stars that appear significantly older. Agreement is shown for ages derived from the Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram and from the empirical mass-radius relationship defined by eclipsing multiple-star systems. Surface magnetic field strengths required to produce agreement are approximately 2.5 kG and are predicted from a priori estimates of thermal equipartition values. A region in the HR diagram is identified that plausibly connects stars whose structures are weakly influenced by the presence of magnetic fields with those whose structures are strongly influenced by magnetic fields. The models suggest that this region is characterized by stars with rapidly thinning outer convective envelopes where the radiative core mass is greater than 75% of the total stellar mass. Furthermore, depletion of lithium predicted from magnetic models appears in better agreement with observed lithium equivalent widths than predictions from non-magnetic models. These results suggest that magnetic inhibition of convection plays an important role in the early evolution of low-mass stars and that it may be responsible for noted age discrepancies in young stellar populations.},

	abstract = {We present ALMA observations of 106 G-, K-, and M-type stars in the Upper Scorpius OB Association hosting circumstellar disks. With these data, we measure the 0.88 mm continuum and 12CO J = 3-2 line fluxes of disks around low-mass (0.14-1.66 M &sun;) stars at an age of 5-11 Myr. Of the 75 primordial disks in the sample, 53 are detected in the dust continuum and 26 in CO. Of the 31 disks classified as debris/evolved transitional disks, five are detected in the continuum and none in CO. The lack of CO emission in approximately half of the disks with detected continuum emission can be explained if CO is optically thick but has a compact emitting area (≲40 au), or if the CO is heavily depleted by a factor of at least ˜1000 relative to interstellar medium abundances and is optically thin. The continuum measurements are used to estimate the dust mass of the disks. We find a correlation between disk dust mass and stellar host mass consistent with a power-law relation of {M}{dust}\propto {M}* 1.67+/- 0.37. Disk dust masses in Upper Sco are compared to those measured in the younger Taurus star-forming region to constrain the evolution of disk dust mass. We find that the difference in the mean of {log}({M}{dust}/{M}* ) between Taurus and Upper Sco is 0.64 $\pm$ 0.09, such that M dust/M * is lower in Upper Sco by a factor of ˜4.5.},

	abstract = {We confirm and characterize a close-in ({P}{{orb}} = 5.425 days), super-Neptune sized ({5.04}-0.37+0.34 {R}\oplus ) planet transiting K2-33 (2MASS J16101473-1919095), a late-type (M3) pre-main-sequence (11 Myr old) star in the Upper Scorpius subgroup of the Scorpius-Centaurus OB association. The host star has the kinematics of a member of the Upper Scorpius OB association, and its spectrum contains lithium absorption, an unambiguous sign of youth (\lt 20 Myr) in late-type dwarfs. We combine photometry from K2 and the ground-based MEarth project to refine the planet's properties and constrain the host star's density. We determine K2-33's bolometric flux and effective temperature from moderate-resolution spectra. By utilizing isochrones that include the effects of magnetic fields, we derive a precise radius (6%-7%) and mass (16%) for the host star, and a stellar age consistent with the established value for Upper Scorpius. Follow-up high-resolution imaging and Doppler spectroscopy confirm that the transiting object is not a stellar companion or a background eclipsing binary blended with the target. The shape of the transit, the constancy of the transit depth and periodicity over 1.5 yr, and the independence with wavelength rule out stellar variability or a dust cloud or debris disk partially occulting the star as the source of the signal; we conclude that it must instead be planetary in origin. The existence of K2-33b suggests that close-in planets can form in situ or migrate within ˜10 Myr, e.g., via interactions with a disk, and that long-timescale dynamical migration such as by Lidov-Kozai or planet-planet scattering is not responsible for all short-period planets.},

	abstract = {We describe a "super-Earth"-size ($2.30\pm0.15R_{\oplus}$) planet transiting an early K-type dwarf star in the Campaign 4 field observed by the K2 mission. The host star, EPIC 210363145, was identified as a member of the approximately 120-Myr-old Pleiades cluster based on its kinematics and photometric distance. It is rotationally variable and exhibits near-ultraviolet emission consistent with a Pleiades age, but its rotational period is ~20 d and its spectrum contains no H$\alpha$ emission nor the Li I absorption expected of Pleiades K dwarfs. Instead, the star is probably an interloper that is unaffiliated with the cluster, but younger (< 1 Gyr) than the typical field dwarf. We ruled out a false positive transit signal produced by confusion with a background eclipsing binary by adaptive optics imaging and a statistical calculation. Doppler radial velocity measurements limit the companion mass to <2 times that of Jupiter. Screening of the lightcurves of 1014 potential Pleiades candidate stars uncovered no additional planets. An injection-and-recovery experiment using the K2 Pleiades lightcurves with simulated planets, assuming a planet population like that in the Kepler prime field, predicts only 0.8-1.8 detections (vs. ~20 in an equivalent Kepler sample). The absence of Pleiades planet detections can be attributed to the much shorter monitoring time of K2 (80 days vs. 4 years), increased measurement noise due to spacecraft motion, and the intrinsic noisiness of the stars.},

	abstract = {We present EPIC Variability Extraction and Removal for Exoplanet Science Targets (EVEREST), an open-source pipeline for removing instrumental noise from K2 light curves. EVEREST employs a variant of pixel level decorrelation to remove systematics introduced by the spacecraft's pointing error and a Gaussian process to capture astrophysical variability. We apply EVEREST to all K2 targets in campaigns 0--7, yielding light curves with precision comparable to that of the original Kepler mission for stars brighter than {K}p≈ 13, and within a factor of two of the Kepler precision for fainter targets. We perform cross-validation and transit injection and recovery tests to validate the pipeline, and compare our light curves to the other de-trended light curves available for download at the MAST High Level Science Products archive. We find that EVEREST achieves the highest average precision of any of these pipelines for unsaturated K2 stars. The improved precision of these light curves will aid in exoplanet detection and characterization, investigations of stellar variability, asteroseismology, and other photometric studies. The EVEREST pipeline can also easily be applied to future surveys, such as the TESS mission, to correct for instrumental systematics and enable the detection of low signal-to-noise transiting exoplanets.

	abstract = {We present 197 planet candidates discovered using data from the first year of the NASA K2 mission (Campaigns 0-4), along with the results of an intensive program of photometric analyses, stellar spectroscopy, high-resolution imaging, and statistical validation. We distill these candidates into sets of 104 validated planets (57 in multi-planet systems), 30 false positives, and 63 remaining candidates. Our validated systems span a range of properties, with median values of R  P  = 2.3 {R}\oplus , P = 8.6 days, {T}{eff} = 5300 K, and Kp = 12.7 mag. Stellar spectroscopy provides precise stellar and planetary parameters for most of these systems. We show that K2 has increased by 30% the number of small planets known to orbit moderately bright stars (1-4 R ⊕, Kp = 9-13 mag). Of particular interest are 76 planets smaller than 2 R ⊕, 15 orbiting stars brighter than Kp = 11.5 mag, 5 receiving Earth-like irradiation levels, and several multi-planet systems---including 4 planets orbiting the M dwarf K2-72 near mean-motion resonances. By quantifying the likelihood that each candidate is a planet we demonstrate that our candidate sample has an overall false positive rate of 15%-30%, with rates substantially lower for small candidates (\lt 2{R}\oplus ) and larger for candidates with radii \gt 8{R}\oplus  and/or with P\lt 3 {{days}}. Extrapolation of the current planetary yield suggests that K2 will discover between 500 and 1000 planets in its planned four-year mission, assuming sufficient follow-up resources are available. Efficient observing and analysis, together with an organized and coherent follow-up strategy, are essential for maximizing the efficacy of planet-validation efforts for K2, TESS, and future large-scale surveys.},

@article{Barros:2016aa,
	abstract = {Context. With only two functional reaction wheels, Kepler cannot maintain stable pointing at its original target field and has entered a new mode of observation called K2.  Aims: We describe a new pipeline to reduce K2 pixel files into light curves that are later searched for transit like features.  Methods: Our method is based on many years of experience in planet hunting for the CoRoT mission. Owing to the unstable pointing, K2 light curves present systematics that are correlated with the target position in the charge coupled device (CCD). Therefore, our pipeline also includes a decorrelation of this systematic noise. Our pipeline is optimised for bright stars for which spectroscopic follow-up is possible. We achieve a maximum precision on 6 hours of 6 ppm. The decorrelated light curves are searched for transits with an adapted version of the CoRoT alarm pipeline.  Results: We present 172 planetary candidates and 327 eclipsing binary candidates from campaigns 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 of K2. Both the planetary candidates and eclipsing binary candidates lists are made public to promote follow-up studies. The light curves will also be available to the community.

@article{Pascucci:2016aa,
	abstract = {The disk mass is among the most important input parameter for every planet formation model to determine the number and masses of the planets that can form. We present an ALMA 887 mum survey of the disk population around objects from ~2 to 0.03 M &sun; in the nearby ~2 Myr old Chamaeleon I star-forming region. We detect thermal dust emission from 66 out of 93 disks, spatially resolve 34 of them, and identify two disks with large dust cavities of about 45 au in radius. Assuming isothermal and optically thin emission, we convert the 887 mum flux densities into dust disk masses, hereafter M dust. We find that the {M}{dust}{--}{M}*  relation is steeper than linear and of the form M dust ∝ (M *)1.3--1.9, where the range in the power-law index reflects two extremes of the possible relation between the average dust temperature and stellar luminosity. By reanalyzing all millimeter data available for nearby regions in a self-consistent way, we show that the 1--3 Myr old regions of Taurus, Lupus, and Chamaeleon I share the same {M}{dust}{--}{M}*  relation, while the 10 Myr old Upper Sco association has a steeper relation. Theoretical models of grain growth, drift, and fragmentation reproduce this trend and suggest that disks are in the fragmentation-limited regime. In this regime millimeter grains will be located closer in around lower-mass stars, a prediction that can be tested with deeper and higher spatial resolution ALMA observations.},

	abstract = {
The Immersion Grating Infrared Spectrometer (IGRINS) is a revolutionary instrument that exploits broad spectral coverage at high-resolution in the near-infrared. IGRINS employs a silicon immersion grating as the primary disperser, and volume-phase holographic gratings cross-disperse the H and K bands onto Teledyne Hawaii-2RG arrays. The use of an immersion grating facilitates a compact cryostat while providing simultaneous wavelength coverage from 1.45 - 2.5 μm. There are no cryogenic mechanisms in IGRINS and its high-throughput design maximizes sensitivity. IGRINS on the 2.7 meter Harlan J. Smith Telescope at McDonald Observatory is nearly as sensitive as CRIRES at the 8 meter Very Large Telescope. However, IGRINS at R≈45,000 has more than 30 times the spectral grasp of CRIRES* in a single exposure. Here we summarize the performance of IGRINS from the first 300 nights of science since commissioning in summer 2014. IGRINS observers have targeted solar system objects like Pluto and Ceres, comets, nearby young stars, star forming regions like Taurus and Ophiuchus, the interstellar medium, photo dissociation regions, the Galactic Center, planetary nebulae, galaxy cores and super novae. The rich near-infrared spectra of these objects motivate unique science cases, and provide information on instrument performance. There are more than ten submitted IGRINS papers and dozens more in preparation. With IGRINS on a 2.7m telescope we realize signal-to-noise ratios greater than 100 for K=10.3 magnitude sources in one hour of exposure time. Although IGRINS is Cassegrain mounted, instrument flexure is sub-pixel thanks to the compact design. Detector characteristics and stability have been tested regularly, allowing us to adjust the instrument operation and improve science quality. A wide variety of science programs motivate new tools for analyzing high-resolution spectra including multiplexed spectral extraction, atmospheric model fitting, rotation and radial velocity, unique line identification, and circumstellar disk modeling. Here we discuss details of instrument performance, summarize early science results, and show the characteristics of IGRINS as a versatile near-infrared spectrograph and forerunner of future silicon immersion grating spectrographs like iSHELL2 and GMTNIRS.3},

@article{UCAC4,
	abstract = {The fourth United States Naval Observatory (USNO) CCD Astrograph Catalog, UCAC4, was released in 2012 August (double-sided DVD and CDS data center Vizier catalog I/322). It is the final release in this series and contains over 113 million objects; over 105 million of them with proper motions (PMs). UCAC4 is an updated version of UCAC3 with about the same number of stars also covering all-sky. Bugs were fixed, Schmidt plate survey data were avoided, and precise five-band photometry was added for about half the stars. Astrograph observations have been supplemented for bright stars by FK6, Hipparcos, and Tycho-2 data to compile a UCAC4 star catalog complete from the brightest stars to about magnitude R = 16. Epoch 1998-2004 positions are obtained from observations with the 20 cm aperture USNO Astrograph's "red lens," equipped with a 4k by 4k CCD. Mean positions and PMs are derived by combining these observations with over 140 ground- and space-based catalogs, including Hipparcos/Tycho and the AC2000.2, as well as unpublished measures of over 5000 plates from other astrographs. For most of the faint stars in the southern hemisphere, the first epoch plates from the Southern Proper Motion program form the basis for PMs, while the Northern Proper Motion first epoch plates serve the same purpose for the rest of the sky. These data are supplemented by 2MASS near-IR photometry for about 110 million stars and five-band (B, V, g, r, i) APASS data for over 51 million stars. Thus the published UCAC4, as were UCAC3 and UCAC2, is a compiled catalog with the UCAC observational program being a major component. The positional accuracy of stars in UCAC4 at mean epoch is about 15-100 mas per coordinate, depending on magnitude, while the formal errors in PMs range from about 1 to 10 mas yr-1 depending on magnitude and observing history. Systematic errors in PMs are estimated to be about 1-4 mas yr-1.},

@article{Dahm2012,
	abstract = {We present projected rotational velocities for 20 early-type (B8-A9) and 74 late-type (F2-M8) members of the ~5 Myr old Upper Scorpius OB Association derived from high-dispersion optical spectra obtained with the High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer on Keck I and the Magellan Inamori Kyocera Echelle on the Magellan Clay telescope. The spectroscopic sample is composed of stars and brown dwarfs with infrared signatures of circumstellar disks, both primordial and debris, and non-excess sources of comparable spectral type. We merge projected rotational velocities, accretion diagnostics, and Spitzer Space Telescope Infrared Array Camera and Multiband Imaging Photometer for Spitzer 24 mum photometry to examine the relationship between rotation and circumstellar disks. The rotational velocities are strongly correlated with spectral type, a proxy for mass, such that the median vsin i for B8-A9-type stars is: 195 $\pm$ 70 km s-1, F2-K4: 37.8 $\pm$ 7.4 km s-1, K5-K9: 13.8+21.3 - 8.2 km s-1, M0-M5: 16.52 $\pm$ 5.3 km s-1, and M5.5-M8: 17.72 $\pm$ 8.1 km s-1. We find with a probability of >=0.99 that M-type stars and brown dwarfs having infrared excess suggestive of circumstellar disks rotate more slowly than their non-excess counterparts. A similar correlation is present among F2-K9-type stars, but only at the ~97% confidence level. Among the early-type (B8-A9) members, rotational velocities of the debris-disk and non-disk populations are indistinguishable. Considering the late-type (F2-M8) stars and brown dwarfs, we find a low fraction of slowly rotating, non-excess sources relative to younger star-forming regions, suggesting that most have spun up following disk dissipation. The few late-type (F2-M5) debris disk sources, which may be representative of stars that have recently dispersed their inner disks, are evenly divided between slow and moderate rotators.},

@article{Mermilliod2009,
	abstract = {Context: We conducted a long-term monitoring of solar-type dwarfs in 13 nearby open clusters, d < 500 pc, over 19 years, but most individual radial velocities were never published, apart from a small number of spectroscopic binaries.  Aims: Our program was designed to study membership and duplicity, and to search for new cluster members. Methods: We obtained 6070 radial velocities during 19 years of observations at the Haute-Provence Observatory (France) and 1130 during 13 years at ESO La Silla (Chile) for 1253 stars in the field of 13 open clusters. The zeropoint of the CORAVEL radial velocity system was improved and the new values supersede those published previously. Results: The membership and binarity of solar-type stars in NGC 1976 (Orion), IC 2602, NGC 7092, and NGC 2682 are briefly discussed. For the entire sample, we confirmed the membership of 894 stars and discovered 150 new spectroscopic binaries among them. Added to those already known in the Hyades and Coma Berenices, the number of member spectroscopic binaries is 188. The overall binary frequency is 30% (188/618) for stars with at least 2 measurements. Since no spectroscopic binaries were found among its 26 members, IC 2602 may however represent an exception. New orbital elements were computed with the updated values of the radial velocities for 66 systems, representing 55 members and 11 non-members. Conclusions: This paper is the final report from our team of CORAVEL radial velocities of solar-type dwarfs in nearby open clusters. All CORAVEL observations for dwarfs and red giants in open clusters are now available in electronic form.  Based on observations collected at the Haute-Provence Observatory (France) and with the Danish 1.54-m at the European Southern Observatory, La Silla, Chile.

@article{Netopil2016,
	abstract = {Context. Open clusters are known as excellent tools for various topics in Galactic research. For example, they allow accurately tracing the chemical structure of the Galactic disc. However, the metallicity is known only for a rather low percentage of the open cluster population, and these values are based on a variety of methods and data. Therefore, a large and homogeneous sample is highly desirable.  Aims: In the third part of our series we compile a large sample of homogenised open cluster metallicities using a wide variety of different sources. These data and a sample of Cepheids are used to investigate the radial metallicity gradient, age effects, and to test current models.  Methods: We used photometric and spectroscopic data to derive cluster metallicities. The different sources were checked and tested for possible offsets and correlations.  Results: In total, metallicities for 172 open cluster were derived. We used the spectroscopic data of 100 objects for a study of the radial metallicity distribution and the age-metallicity relation. We found a possible increase of metallicity with age, which, if confirmed, would provide observational evidence for radial migration. Although a statistical significance is given, more studies are certainly needed to exclude selection effects, for example. The comparison of open clusters and Cepheids with recent Galactic models agrees well in general. However, the models do not reproduce the flat gradient of the open clusters in the outer disc. Thus, the effect of radial migration is either underestimated in the models, or an additional mechanism is at work.  Conclusions: Apart from the Cepheids, open clusters are the best tracers for metallicity over large Galactocentric distances in the Milky Way. For a sound statistical analysis, a sufficiently large and homogeneous sample of cluster metallicities is needed. Our compilation is currently by far the largest and provides the basis for several basic studies such as the statistical treatment of the Galactic cluster population, or evolutionary studies of individual star groups in open clusters.},

@article{Boesgaard2013,
	abstract = {Star clusters have long been used to illuminate both stellar evolution and Galactic evolution. They also hold clues to the chemical and nucleosynthetic processes throughout the history of the Galaxy. We have taken high signal-to-noise (S/N), high-resolution spectra of 11 solar-type stars in the Praesepe open cluster to determine the chemical abundances of 16 elements: Li, C, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Fe, Ni, Y, and Ba. We have determined Fe from Fe I and Fe II lines and find [Fe/H] = +0.12 $\pm$0.04. We find that Li decreases with temperature due to increasing Li depletion in cooler stars; it matches the Li-temperature pattern found in the Hyades. The [C/Fe] and [O/Fe] abundances are below solar and lower than the field star samples due to the younger age of Praesepe (0.7 Gyr) than the field stars. The alpha-elements, Mg, Si, Ca, and Ti, have solar ratios with respect to Fe, and are also lower than the field star samples. The Fe-peak elements, Cr and Ni, track Fe and have solar values. The neutron capture element [Y/Fe] is found to be solar, but [Ba/Fe] is enhanced relative to solar and to the field stars. Three Praesepe giants were studied by Carrera and Pancino; they are apparently enhanced in Na, Mg, and Ba relative to the Praesepe dwarfs. The Na enhancement may indicate proton-capture nucleosynthesis in the Ne --> Na cycling with dredge-up into the atmospheres of the red giants.},

@article{Fraine2014,
	abstract = {Transmission spectroscopy has so far detected atomic and molecular absorption in Jupiter-sized exoplanets, but intense efforts to measure molecular absorption in the atmospheres of smaller (Neptune-sized) planets during transits have revealed only featureless spectra. From this it was concluded that the majority of small, warm planets evolve to sustain atmospheres with high mean molecular weights (little hydrogen), opaque clouds or scattering hazes, reducing our ability to observe the composition of these atmospheres. Here we report observations of the transmission spectrum of the exoplanet HAT-P-11b (which has a radius about four times that of Earth) from the optical wavelength range to the infrared. We detected water vapour absorption at a wavelength of 1.4 micrometres. The amplitude of the water absorption (approximately 250 parts per million) indicates that the planetary atmosphere is predominantly clear down to an altitude corresponding to about 1 millibar, and sufficiently rich in hydrogen to have a large scale height (over which the atmospheric pressure varies by a factor of e). The spectrum is indicative of a planetary atmosphere in which the abundance of heavy elements is no greater than about 700 times the solar value. This is in good agreement with the core-accretion theory of planet formation, in which a gas giant planet acquires its atmosphere by accreting hydrogen-rich gas directly from the protoplanetary nebula onto a large rocky or icy core.},

	abstract = {The K2 Mission uses the Kepler spacecraft to obtain high-precision photometry over ≈80 day campaigns in the ecliptic plane. The Ecliptic Plane Input Catalog (EPIC) provides coordinates, photometry, and kinematics based on a federation of all-sky catalogs to support target selection and target management for the K2 mission. We describe the construction of the EPIC, as well as modifications and shortcomings of the catalog. Kepler magnitudes (Kp) are shown to be accurate to ≈0.1 mag for the Kepler field, and the EPIC is typically complete to Kp ≈ 17 (Kp ≈ 19 for campaigns covered by Sloan Digital Sky Survey). We furthermore classify 138,600 targets in Campaigns 1-8 (≈88% of the full target sample) using colors, proper motions, spectroscopy, parallaxes, and galactic population synthesis models, with typical uncertainties for G-type stars of ≈3% in {T}{{eff}}, ≈0.3 dex in {log} g, ≈40% in radius, ≈10% in mass, and ≈40% in distance. Our results show that stars targeted by K2 are dominated by K-M dwarfs (≈41% of all selected targets), F-G dwarfs (≈36%), and K giants (≈21%), consistent with key K2 science programs to search for transiting exoplanets and galactic archeology studies using oscillating red giants. However, we find significant variation of the fraction of cool dwarfs with galactic latitude, indicating a target selection bias due to interstellar reddening and increased contamination by giant stars near the galactic plane. We discuss possible systematic errors in the derived stellar properties, and differences with published classifications for K2 exoplanet host stars. The EPIC is hosted at the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST): http://archive.stsci.edu/k2/epic/search.php.},

@article{Newton2016,
	abstract = {Rotation is a directly observable stellar property, and it drives magnetic field generation and activity through a magnetic dynamo. Main-sequence stars with masses below approximately 0.35 {M}&sun;  (mid-to-late M dwarfs) are fully convective, and are expected to have a different type of dynamo mechanism than solar-type stars. Measurements of their rotation rates provide insight into these mechanisms, but few rotation periods are available for these stars at field ages. Using photometry from the MEarth Project, we measure rotation periods for 387 nearby, mid-to-late M dwarfs in the northern hemisphere, finding periods from 0.1 to 140 days. The typical rotator has stable, sinusoidal photometric modulations at a semi-amplitude of 0.5%-1%. We find no period-amplitude relation for stars below 0.25 {M}&sun;  and an anticorrelation between period and amplitude for higher-mass M dwarfs. We highlight the existence of older, slowly rotating stars without Halpha emission that nevertheless have strong photometric variability. We use parallaxes, proper motions, radial velocities, photometry, and near-infrared metallicity estimates to further characterize the population of rotators. The Galactic kinematics of our sample is consistent with the local population of G and K dwarfs, and rotators have metallicities characteristic of the solar neighborhood. We use the W space velocities and established age-velocity relations to estimate that stars with P < 10 days have ages of on average <2 Gyr, and that those with P > 70 days have ages of about 5 Gyr. The period distribution is dependent on mass: as the mass decreases, the slowest rotators at a given mass have longer periods, and the fastest rotators have shorter periods. We find a lack of stars with intermediate rotation periods, and the gap between the fast and slow rotators is larger for lower masses. Our data are consistent with a scenario in which these stars maintain rapid rotation for several gigayears, then spin down quickly, reaching periods of around 100 days by a typical age of 5 Gyr.},

	abstract = {We present the discovery in Kepler's K2 mission observations and our follow-up radial velocity (RV) observations from Keck/HIRES for four eclipsing binary (EB) star systems in the young benchmark Pleiades and Hyades clusters. Based on our modeling results, we announce two new low mass ({M}{tot}\lt 0.6 {M}&sun; ) EBs among Pleiades members (HCG 76 and MHO 9) and we report on two previously known Pleiades binaries that are also found to be EB systems (HII 2407 and HD 23642). We measured the masses of the binary HCG 76 to ≲2.5% precision, and the radii to ≲4.5% precision, which together with the precise effective temperatures yield an independent Pleiades distance of 132 $\pm$ 5 pc. We discuss another EB toward the Pleiades that is a possible but unlikely Pleiades cluster member (AK II 465). The two new confirmed Pleiades systems extend the mass range of Pleiades EB components to 0.2-2 {M}&sun; . Our initial measurements of the fundamental stellar parameters for the Pleiades EBs are discussed in the context of the current stellar models and the nominal cluster isochrone, finding good agreement with the stellar models of Baraffe et al. at the nominal Pleiades age of 120 Myr. Finally, in the Hyades, we report a new low mass eclipsing system (vA 50) that was concurrently discovered and studied by Mann et al. We confirm that the eclipse is likely caused by a Neptune-sized transiting planet, and with the additional RV constraints presented here we improve the constraint on the maximum mass of the planet to be ≲1.2 MJup.},

	abstract = {The starlight we see comes from the outer layers of a star, from the region known as the photosphere. Most of what we know about stars is learned by studying the light from the photosphere. This book describes the equipment, observational techniques and analysis used in the investigation of stellar photospheres. The opening chapters describe the basic tools, such as spectrographs and light detectors, as well as the physics of radiative transfer and the construction of models. Next the author introduces the measurement and modelling of the continuum spectrum. This is followed by the study of spectral line radiation. The final chapters explain how these techniques enable astronomers to deduce valuable information on basic properties of stars. For example, temperature, radius, surface gravity, chemical composition, rotation rate, and velocity fields can be derived from stellar spectroscopy.},

@article{Colon2012,
	abstract = {Using the Optical System for Imaging and low Resolution Integrated Spectroscopy (OSIRIS) instrument installed on the 10.4-m Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC), we acquired multicolour transit photometry of four small (Rp≲5 R⊕) short-period (P ≲ 6  d) planet candidates recently identified by the Kepler space mission. These observations are part of a programme to constrain the false positive rate for small, short-period Kepler planet candidates. Since planetary transits should be largely achromatic when observed at different wavelengths (excluding the small colour changes due to stellar limb darkening), we use the observed transit colour to identify candidates as either false positives (e.g. a blend with a stellar eclipsing binary either in the background/foreground or bound to the target star) or validated planets. Our results include the identification of KOI 225.01 and KOI 1187.01 as false positives and the tentative validation of KOI 420.01 and KOI 526.01 as planets. The probability of identifying two false positives out of a sample of four targets is less than 1 per cent, assuming an overall false positive rate for Kepler planet candidates of 10 per cent (as estimated by Morton & Johnson). Therefore, these results suggest a higher false positive rate for the small, short-period Kepler planet candidates than has been theoretically predicted by other studies which consider the Kepler planet candidate sample as a whole. Furthermore, our results are consistent with a recent Doppler study of short-period giant Kepler planet candidates. We also investigate how the false positive rate for our sample varies with different planetary and stellar properties. Our results suggest that the false positive rate varies significantly with orbital period and is largest at the shortest orbital periods (P < 3  d), where there is a corresponding rise in the number of detached eclipsing binary stars (i.e. systems that can easily mimic planetary transits) that have been discovered by Kepler. However, we do not find significant correlations between the false positive rate and other planetary or stellar properties. Our sample size is not yet large enough to determine if orbital period plays the largest role in determining the false positive rate, but we discuss plans for future observations of additional Kepler candidates and compare our programme focusing on relatively faint Kepler targets from the GTC with follow-up of Kepler targets that has been done with warm-Spitzer.},

	abstract = {We classified the reddest (r - J > 2.2) stars observed by the NASA Kepler mission into main-sequence dwarf or evolved giant stars and determined the properties of 4216 M dwarfs based on a comparison of available photometry with that of nearby calibrator stars, as well as available proper motions and spectra. We revised the properties of candidate transiting planets using the stellar parameters, high-resolution imaging to identify companion stars, and, in the case of binaries, fitting light curves to identify the likely planet host. In 49 of 54 systems, we validated the primary as the host star. We inferred the intrinsic distribution of M dwarf planets using the method of iterative Monte Carlo simulation. We compared several models of planet orbital geometry and clustering and found that one where planets are exponentially distributed and almost precisely coplanar best describes the distribution of multiplanet systems. We determined that Kepler M dwarfs host an average of 2.2 $\pm$ 0.3 planets with radii of 1-4 R⊕ and orbital periods of 1.5-180 d. The radius distribution peaks at ˜1.2 R⊕ and is essentially zero at 4 R⊕, although we identify three giant planet candidates other than the previously confirmed Kepler-45b. There is suggestive but not significant evidence that the radius distribution varies with orbital period. The distribution with logarithmic orbital period is flat except for a decline for orbits less than a few days. 12 candidate planets, including two Jupiter-size objects, experience an irradiance below the threshold level for a runaway greenhouse on an Earth-like planet and are thus in a `habitable zone'.},

@article{Mann2016a,
	abstract = {Studying the properties of young planetary systems can shed light on how the dynamics and structure of planets evolve during their most formative years. Recent K2 observations of nearby young clusters (10--800 Myr) have facilitated the discovery of such planetary systems. Here we report the discovery of a Neptune-sized planet transiting an M4.5 dwarf (K2-25) in the Hyades cluster (650--800 Myr). The light curve shows a strong periodic signal at 1.88 days, which we attribute to spot coverage and rotation. We confirm that the planet host is a member of the Hyades by measuring the radial velocity of the system with the high-resolution near-infrared spectrograph Immersion Grating Infrared Spectrometer. This enables us to calculate a distance based on K2-25's kinematics and membership to the Hyades, which in turn provides a stellar radius and mass to ~=5%--10%, better than what is currently possible for most Kepler M dwarfs (12%--20%). We use the derived stellar density as a prior on fitting the K2 transit photometry, which provides weak constraints on eccentricity. Utilizing a combination of adaptive optics imaging and high-resolution spectra, we rule out the possibility that the signal is due to a bound or background eclipsing binary, confirming the transits' planetary origin. K2-25b has a radius ({3.43}-0.31+0.95 R⊕) much larger than older Kepler planets with similar orbital periods (3.485 days) and host-star masses (0.29 M&sun;). This suggests that close-in planets lose some of their atmospheres past the first few hundred million years. Additional transiting planets around the Hyades, Pleiades, and Praesepe clusters from K2 will help confirm whether this planet is atypical or representative of other close-in planets of similar age.},

	abstract = {Context. In several instances chemical abundances of main-sequence and giant stars are used simultaneously under the assumption that they share the same abundance scale. This assumption, if wrong, might have important implications in different astrophysical contexts.  Aims: It is therefore crucial to understand whether the metallicity or abundance differences among dwarfs and giants are real or are produced by systematic errors in the analysis. We aim to ascertain a methodology capable of producing a consistent metallicity scale for giants and dwarfs.  Methods: To achieve that, we analyzed giants and dwarfs in the Hyades open cluster, under the assumption that they share the same chemical composition. All the stars in this cluster have archival high-resolution spectroscopic data obtained with HARPS and UVES. In addition, the giants have interferometric measurements of the angular diameters. We analyzed the sample with two methods. The first method constrains the atmospheric parameters independently from spectroscopic method. For that we present a novel calibration of microturbulence based on 3D model atmospheres. The second method is the classical spectroscopic analysis based on Fe lines. We also tested two different line lists in an attempt to minimize possible non-LTE effects and to optimize the treatment of the giants.  Results: We show that it is possible to obtain a consistent metallicity scale between dwarfs and giants. The preferred method should constrain the three parameters Teff, log g, and xi independent of spectroscopy. A careful selection of Fe lines is also important. In particular, the lines should not be chosen based on the Sun or other dwarfs, but specifically to be free of blends in the spectra of giants. When attention is paid to the line list, the classical spectroscopic method can also produce consistent results. In our test, the metallicities derived with the well-constrained set of stellar parameters are consistent independent of the line list used. Therefore, for this cluster we favor the metallicity of +0.18 $\pm$ 0.03 dex obtained with this method. The classical spectroscopic analysis, using the line list optimized for the giants, provides a metallicity of +0.14 $\pm$ 0.03 dex, in agreement with previous works.  Based on data obtained from the ESO Science Archive Facility. The observations were made with ESO Telescopes at the La Silla and Paranal Observatories under programmes ID 070.D-0356, 088.C-0513 and 070.D-0421.},

	abstract = {We confirm a 0.995 day periodic planetary transit-like signal, KOI 6705.01, in the Kepler light curve of the star KIC 6423922. Optical and infrared spectra show that this star is a mid M-type dwarf with an effective temperature =\3327+/- 60 K, metallicity [Fe/H] = -0.08 $\pm$ 0.10, radius =\0.31+/- 0.03R&sun;, and mass = 0.28 $\pm$ 0.05M&sun;. The star is ≈ 70 pc away and its space motion, rotation period, and lack of Halpha emission indicate it is an older member of the ``thin disk'' population. On the other hand, the star exhibits excess infrared emission suggesting a dust disk more typical of a very young star. If the KOI 6705.01 signal is produced by a planet, the transit depth of 60 ppm means its radius is only {0.26}-0.029+0.034R⊕, or about the size of the Moon. However, the duration (≳ 3 hr) and time variation of KOI 6705.01 are anomalous: the signal was undetected in the first two years of the mission and increased through the latter two years. These characteristics require implausible orbits and material properties for any planet and rule out such an explanation, although a dust cloud is possible. We excluded several false positive scenarios including background stars, scattered light from stars that are nearby on the sky, and electronic cross-talk between detector readout channels. We find the most likely explanation to be that KOI 6705.01 is a false positive created by charge transfer inefficiency in a detector column on which KIC 6423922 and a 1.99 day eclipsing binary both happened to fall.},

	abstract = {I introduce BATMAN, a Python package for modeling exoplanet transit and eclipse light curves. The BATMAN package supports calculation of light curves for any radially symmetric stellar limb darkening law, using a new integration algorithm for models that cannot be quickly calculated analytically. The code uses C extension modules to speed up model calculation and is parallelized with OpenMP. For a typical light curve with 100 data points in transit, batman can calculate one million quadratic limb-darkened models in 30 s with a single 1.7 GHz Intel Core i5 processor. The same calculation takes seven minutes using the four-parameter nonlinear limb darkening model (computed to 1 ppm accuracy). Maximum truncation error for integrated models is an input parameter that can be set as low as 0.001 ppm, ensuring that the community is prepared for the precise transit light curves we anticipate measuring with upcoming facilities. The batman package is open source and publicly available at https://github.com/lkreidberg/batman.},

	abstract = {M-dwarf stars---hydrogen-burning stars that are smaller than 60 per cent of the size of the Sun---are the most common class of star in our Galaxy and outnumber Sun-like stars by a ratio of 12:1. Recent results have shown that M dwarfs host Earth-sized planets in great numbers: the average number of M-dwarf planets that are between 0.5 to 1.5 times the size of Earth is at least 1.4 per star. The nearest such planets known to transit their star are 39 parsecs away, too distant for detailed follow-up observations to measure the planetary masses or to study their atmospheres. Here we report observations of GJ 1132b, a planet with a size of 1.2 Earth radii that is transiting a small star 12 parsecs away. Our Doppler mass measurement of GJ 1132b yields a density consistent with an Earth-like bulk composition, similar to the compositions of the six known exoplanets with masses less than six times that of the Earth and precisely measured densities. Receiving 19 times more stellar radiation than the Earth, the planet is too hot to be habitable but is cool enough to support a substantial atmosphere, one that has probably been considerably depleted of hydrogen. Because the host star is nearby and only 21 per cent the radius of the Sun, existing and upcoming telescopes will be able to observe the composition and dynamics of the planetary atmosphere.},

	abstract = {We present a catalog of near-infrared (NIR) spectra and associated measurements for 886 nearby M dwarfs. The spectra were obtained with the NASA-Infrared Telescope Facility SpeX Spectrograph during a two-year observing campaign; they have high signal-to-noise ratios (S/N > 100-150), span 0.8-2.4 mum, and have R˜ 2000. Our catalog of measured values contains useful Teff and composition-sensitive features, empirical stellar parameter measurements, and kinematic, photometric, and astrometric properties compiled from the literature. We focus on measurements of M dwarf abundances ([Fe/H] and [M/H]), capitalizing on the precision of recently published empirical NIR spectroscopic calibrations. We explore systematic differences between different abundance calibrations, and from other similar M dwarf catalogs. We confirm that the M dwarf abundances we measure show the expected inverse dependence with kinematic-, activity-, and color-based age indicators. Finally, we provide updated [Fe/H] and [M/H] for 16 M dwarf planet hosts. This catalog represents the largest published compilation of NIR spectra and associated parameters for M dwarfs. It provides a rich and uniform resource for nearby M dwarfs, and will be especially valuable for measuring Habitable Zone locations and comparative abundances of the M dwarf planet hosts that will be uncovered by upcoming exoplanet surveys.},

@article{West2015,
	abstract = {Using spectroscopic observations and photometric light curves of 238 nearby M dwarfs from the MEarth exoplanet transit survey, we examine the relationships between magnetic activity (quantified by Halpha emission), rotation period, and stellar age. Previous attempts to investigate the relationship between magnetic activity and rotation in these stars were hampered by the limited number of M dwarfs with measured rotation periods (and the fact that v sin i measurements probe only rapid rotation). However, the photometric data from MEarth allows us to probe a wide range of rotation periods for hundreds of M dwarf stars (from shorter than one to longer than 100 days). Over all M spectral types that we probe, we find that the presence of magnetic activity is tied to rotation, including for late-type, fully convective M dwarfs. We also find evidence that the fraction of late-type M dwarfs that are active may be higher at longer rotation periods compared to their early-type counterparts, with several active, late-type, slowly rotating stars present in our sample. Additionally, we find that all M dwarfs with rotation periods shorter than 26 days (early-type; M1-M4) and 86 days (late-type; M5-M8) are magnetically active. This potential mismatch suggests that the physical mechanisms that connect stellar rotation to chromospheric heating may be different in fully convective stars. A kinematic analysis suggests that the magnetically active, rapidly rotating stars are consistent with a kinematically young population, while slow-rotators are less active or inactive and appear to belong to an older, dynamically heated stellar population.},

@article{Dressing2015,
	abstract = {We present an improved estimate of the occurrence rate of small planets orbiting small stars by searching the full four-year Kepler data set for transiting planets using our own planet detection pipeline and conducting transit injection and recovery simulations to empirically measure the search completeness of our pipeline. We identified 156 planet candidates, including one object that was not previously identified as a Kepler Object of Interest. We inspected all publicly available follow-up images, observing notes, and centroid analyses, and corrected for the likelihood of false positives. We evaluated the sensitivity of our detection pipeline on a star-by-star basis by injecting 2000 transit signals into the light curve of each target star. For periods shorter than 50 days, we find {0.56}-0.05+0.06 Earth-size planets (1-1.5 R⊕) and {0.46}-0.05+0.07 super-Earths (1.5-2 R⊕) per M dwarf. In total, we estimate a cumulative planet occurrence rate of 2.5 $\pm$ 0.2 planets per M dwarf with radii 1-4 R⊕ and periods shorter than 200 days. Within a conservatively defined habitable zone (HZ) based on the moist greenhouse inner limit and maximum greenhouse outer limit, we estimate an occurrence rate of {0.16}-0.07+0.17 Earth-size planets and {0.12}-0.05+0.10 super-Earths per M dwarf HZ. Adopting the broader insolation boundaries of the recent Venus and early Mars limits yields a higher estimate of {0.24}-0.08+0.18 Earth-size planets and {0.21}-0.06+0.11 super-Earths per M dwarf HZ. This suggests that the nearest potentially habitable non-transiting and transiting Earth-size planets are 2.6 $\pm$ 0.4 pc and {10.6}-1.8+1.6 pc away, respectively. If we include super-Earths, these distances diminish to 2.1 $\pm$ 0.2 pc and {8.6}-0.8+0.7 pc.},

	abstract = {We present the results of a blind exercise to test the recoverability of stellar rotation and differential rotation in Kepler light curves. The simulated light curves lasted 1000 d and included activity cycles, Sun-like butterfly patterns, differential rotation and spot evolution. The range of rotation periods, activity levels and spot lifetime were chosen to be representative of the Kepler data of solar-like stars. Of the 1000 simulated light curves, 770 were injected into actual quiescent Kepler light curves to simulate Kepler noise. The test also included five 1000-d segments of the Sun's total irradiance variations at different points in the Sun's activity cycle. Five teams took part in the blind exercise, plus two teams who participated after the content of the light curves had been released. The methods used included Lomb-Scargle periodograms and variants thereof, autocorrelation function and wavelet-based analyses, plus spot modelling to search for differential rotation. The results show that the `overall' period is well recovered for stars exhibiting low and moderate activity levels. Most teams reported values within 10 per cent of the true value in 70 per cent of the cases. There was, however, little correlation between the reported and simulated values of the differential rotation shear, suggesting that differential rotation studies based on full-disc light curves alone need to be treated with caution, at least for solar-type stars. The simulated light curves and associated parameters are available online for the community to test their own methods.},

@article{Luger2015,
	abstract = {We show that terrestrial planets in the habitable zones of M dwarfs older than $\sim$ 1 Gyr could have been in runaway greenhouses for several hundred Myr following their formation due to the star's extended pre-main sequence phase, provided they form with abundant surface water. Such prolonged runaway greenhouses can lead to planetary evolution divergent from that of Earth. During this early runaway phase, photolysis of water vapor and hydrogen/oxygen escape to space can lead to the loss of several Earth oceans of water from planets throughout the habitable zone, regardless of whether the escape is energy-limited or diffusion-limited. We find that the amount of water lost scales with the planet mass, since the diffusion-limited hydrogen escape flux is proportional to the planet surface gravity. In addition to undergoing potential desiccation, planets with inefficient oxygen sinks at the surface may build up hundreds to thousands of bars of abiotically produced O$_2$, resulting in potential false positives for life. The amount of O$_2$ that builds up also scales with the planet mass; we find that O$_2$ builds up at a constant rate that is controlled by diffusion: $\sim$ 5 bars/Myr on Earth-mass planets and up to $\sim$ 25 bars/Myr on super-Earths. As a result, some recently discovered super-Earths in the habitable zone such as GJ 667Cc could have built up as many as 2000 bars of O$_2$ due to the loss of up to 10 Earth oceans of water. The fate of a given planet strongly depends on the extreme ultraviolet flux, the duration of the runaway regime, the initial water content, and the rate at which oxygen is absorbed by the surface. In general, we find that the initial phase of high luminosity may compromise the habitability of many terrestrial planets orbiting low mass stars.},

@article{Lammer2014,
	abstract = {We investigate the origin and loss of captured hydrogen envelopes from protoplanets having masses in a range between `sub-Earth'-like bodies of 0.1 M⊕ and `super-Earths' with 5 M⊕ in the habitable zone at 1 au of a Sun-like G star, assuming that their rocky cores had formed before the nebula gas dissipated. We model the gravitational attraction and accumulation of nebula gas around a planet's core as a function of protoplanetary luminosity during accretion and calculate the resulting surface temperature by solving the hydrostatic structure equations for the protoplanetary nebula. Depending on nebular properties, such as the dust grain depletion factor, planetesimal accretion rates, and resulting luminosities, for planetary bodies of 0.1-1 M⊕ we obtain hydrogen envelopes with masses between ˜2.5 × 1019 and 1.5 × 1026 g. For `super-Earths' with masses between 2 and 5 M⊕ more massive hydrogen envelopes within the mass range of ˜7.5 × 1023-1.5 × 1028 g can be captured from the nebula. For studying the escape of these accumulated hydrogen-dominated protoatmospheres, we apply a hydrodynamic upper atmosphere model and calculate the loss rates due to the heating by the high soft-X-ray and extreme ultraviolet (XUV) flux of the young Sun/star. The results of our study indicate that under most nebula conditions `sub-Earth' and Earth-mass planets can lose their captured hydrogen envelopes by thermal escape during the first ˜100 Myr after the disc dissipated. However, if a nebula has a low dust depletion factor or low accretion rates resulting in low protoplanetary luminosities, it is possible that even protoplanets with Earth-mass cores may keep their hydrogen envelopes during their whole lifetime. In contrast to lower mass protoplanets, more massive `super-Earths', which can accumulate a huge amount of nebula gas, lose only tiny fractions of their primordial hydrogen envelopes. Our results agree with the fact that Venus, Earth, and Mars are not surrounded by dense hydrogen envelopes, as well as with the recent discoveries of low density `super-Earths' that most likely could not get rid of their dense protoatmospheres.},

	abstract = {We present Bayesian Analysis for Nearby Young AssociatioNs II (BANYAN II), a modified Bayesian analysis for assessing the membership of later-than-M5 objects to any of several Nearby Young Associations (NYAs). In addition to using kinematic information (from sky position and proper motion), this analysis exploits 2MASS-WISE color-magnitude diagrams in which old and young objects follow distinct sequences. As an improvement over our earlier work, the spatial and kinematic distributions for each association are now modeled as ellipsoids whose axes need not be aligned with the Galactic coordinate axes, and we use prior probabilities matching the expected populations of the NYAs considered versus field stars. We present an extensive contamination analysis to characterize the performance of our new method. We find that Bayesian probabilities are generally representative of contamination rates, except when a parallax measurement is considered. In this case contamination rates become significantly smaller and hence Bayesian probabilities for NYA memberships are pessimistic. We apply this new algorithm to a sample of 158 objects from the literature that are either known to display spectroscopic signs of youth or have unusually red near-infrared colors for their spectral type. Based on our analysis, we identify 25 objects as new highly probable candidates to NYAs, including a new M7.5 bona fide member to Tucana-Horologium, making it the latest-type member. In addition, we reveal that a known L2gamma dwarf is co-moving with a bright M5 dwarf, and we show for the first time that two of the currently known ultra red L dwarfs are strong candidates to the AB Doradus moving group. Several objects identified here as highly probable members to NYAs could be free-floating planetary-mass objects if their membership is confirmed.},

	abstract = {Context: A new reduction of the astrometric data as produced by the Hipparcos mission has been published, claiming that the accuracies for nearly all stars brighter than magnitude Hp = 8 are improved, by up to a factor 4, compared to the original catalogue. As correlations between the underlying abscissa residuals have also been reduced by more than an order of magnitude to an insignificant level, our ability to determine reliable parallaxes and proper motions for open clusters should be improved.  Aims: The new Hipparcos astrometric catalogue is used to derive mean parallax and proper motion estimates for 20 open clusters. The HR-diagrams of the nearest clusters are compared and combined to provide future input to sets of observational isochrones. Methods: Three different methods are applied, according to the proximity of the cluster, to compensate, where needed, for projection effects, spread in position along the line of sight, and the internal velocity dispersion of the cluster stars.  Results: The new parallaxes have accuracies between 2 and 2.5 times higher than what had been derived from the original Hipparcos catalogue. At least two to three groups of clusters, mostly of similar ages, are observed to each occupy their own specific space in the HR diagram. A significant discrepancy in distance moduli from those obtained with isochrone-based main-sequence fitting remains, in particular for one of these groups, containing the Pleiades, NGC 2516, and Blanco 1. The difference in absolute magnitudes between this group and one containing the Hyades and Praesepe clusters appears to be correlated with systematic differences in the Str{\"o}mgren Delta c0 index between those groups. The same dependency has been known to exist for a long time, and is again confirmed by the Hipparcos data, in variations in absolute magnitudes for field stars of the same effective temperature.  Conclusions: The positions of the cluster HR diagrams are consistent within different groups of clusters shown for example by the near-perfect alignment of the sequences for the Hyades and Praesepe, for Coma Ber and UMa, and for the Pleiades, NGC 2516, and Blanco 1. The groups are mutually consistent when systematic differences in Delta c0 are taken into account, where the effect of these differences on the absolute magnitudes has been calibrated using field-star observations.},

	abstract = {The Immersion Grating Infrared Spectrometer (IGRINS) is a compact high-resolution near-infrared cross-dispersed spectrograph whose primary disperser is a silicon immersion grating. IGRINS covers the entire portion of the wavelength range between 1.45 and 2.45mum that is accessible from the ground and does so in a single exposure with a resolving power of 40,000. Individual volume phase holographic (VPH) gratings serve as cross-dispersing elements for separate spectrograph arms covering the H and K bands. On the 2.7m Harlan J. Smith telescope at the McDonald Observatory, the slit size is 1ʺ x 15ʺ and the plate scale is 0.27ʺ pixel. The spectrograph employs two 2048 x 2048 pixel Teledyne Scientific and Imaging HAWAII-2RG detectors with SIDECAR ASIC cryogenic controllers. The instrument includes four subsystems; a calibration unit, an input relay optics module, a slit-viewing camera, and nearly identical H and K spectrograph modules. The use of a silicon immersion grating and a compact white pupil design allows the spectrograph collimated beam size to be only 25mm, which permits a moderately sized (0.96m x 0.6m x 0.38m) rectangular cryostat to contain the entire spectrograph. The fabrication and assembly of the optical and mechanical components were completed in 2013. We describe the major design characteristics of the instrument including the system requirements and the technical strategy to meet them. We also present early performance test results obtained from the commissioning runs at the McDonald Observatory.},

	abstract = {This paper studies the long-term evolution of planetary systems containing short-period planets, including the effects of tidal circularization, secular excitation of eccentricity by companion planets, and stellar damping. For planetary systems subject to all of these effects, analytic solutions (or approximations) are presented for the time evolution of the semimajor axes and eccentricities. Secular interactions enhance the inward migration and accretion of hot Jupiters, while general relativity tends to act in opposition by reducing the effectiveness of the secular perturbations. The analytic solutions presented herein allow us to understand these effects over a wide range of parameter space and to isolate the effects of general relativity in these planetary systems.},

@article{Bastien2014,
	abstract = {Most extrasolar planets have been detected by their influence on their parent star, typically either gravitationally (the Doppler method) or by the small dip in brightness as the planet blocks a portion of the star (the transit method). Therefore, the accuracy with which we know the masses and radii of extrasolar planets depends directly on how well we know those of the stars, the latter usually determined from the measured stellar surface gravity, log g. Recent work has demonstrated that the short-timescale brightness variations ("flicker") of stars can be used to measure log g to a high accuracy of ~0.1-0.2 dex. Here, we use flicker measurements of 289 bright (Kepmag < 13) candidate planet-hosting stars with T eff = 4500-6650 K to re-assess the stellar parameters and determine the resulting impact on derived planet properties. This re-assessment reveals that for the brightest planet-host stars, Malmquist bias contaminates the stellar sample with evolved stars: nearly 50% of the bright planet-host stars are subgiants. As a result, the stellar radii, and hence the radii of the planets orbiting these stars, are on average 20%-30% larger than previous measurements had suggested.},

@article{Hartman2015,
	abstract = {We report the discovery by the HATSouth survey of HATS-6b, an extrasolar planet transiting a V = 15.2 mag, i = 13.7 mag M1V star with a mass of 0.57 {{M}o } and a radius of 0.57 {{R}o }. HATS-6b has a period of P = 3.3253 d, mass of {{M}p} = 0.32 {{M}J}, radius of {{R}p} = 1.00 {{R}J}, and zero-albedo equilibrium temperature of {{T}eq} = 712.8 $\pm$ 5.1 K. HATS-6 is one of the lowest mass stars known to host a close-in gas giant planet, and its transits are among the deepest of any known transiting planet system. We discuss the follow-up opportunities afforded by this system, noting that despite the faintness of the host star, it is expected to have the highest K-band S/N transmission spectrum among known gas giant planets with {{T}eq}\lt 750 K. In order to characterize the star we present a new set of empirical relations between the density, radius, mass, bolometric magnitude, and V-, J-, H- and K-band bolometric corrections for main sequence stars with M\lt 0.80 {{M}o }, or spectral types later than K5. These relations are calibrated using eclipsing binary components as well as members of resolved binary systems. We account for intrinsic scatter in the relations in a self-consistent manner. We show that from the transit-based stellar density alone it is possible to measure the mass and radius of a ~0.6 {{M}o } star to ~7 and ~2% precision, respectively. Incorporating additional information, such as the V-K color, or an absolute magnitude, allows the precision to be improved by up to a factor of two.  The HATSouth network is operated by a collaboration consisting of Princeton University (PU), the Max Planck Institute f{\"u}r Astronomie (MPIA), the Australian National University (ANU), and the Pontificia Universidad Cat{\'o}lica de Chile (PUC). The station at Las Campanas Observatory (LCO) of the Carnegie Institute is operated by PU in conjunction with PUC, the station at the High Energy Spectroscopic Survey (H.E.S.S.) site is operated in conjunction with MPIA, and the station at Siding Spring Observatory (SSO) is operated jointly with ANU. This paper includes data gathered with the 6.5 m Magellan Telescopes located as Las Campanas Observatory, Chile. Based in part on observations made with the MPG 2.2 m Telescope and the ESO 3.6 m Telescope at the ESO Observatory in La Silla.

	abstract = {We present a large-scale, volume-limited companion survey of 245 late-K to mid-M (K7-M6) dwarfs within 15 pc. Infrared adaptive optics (AO) data were analysed from the Very Large Telescope, Subaru Telescope, Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope, and MMT Observatory to detect close companions to the sample from ˜ 1 to 100 au, while digitized wide-field archival plates were searched for wide companions from ˜ 100 to 10 000 au. With sensitivity to the bottom of the main sequence over a separation range of 3 to 10 000 au, multiple AO and wide-field epochs allow us to confirm candidates with common proper motions, minimize background contamination, and enable a measurement of comprehensive binary statistics. We detected 65 comoving stellar companions and find a companion star fraction of 23.5 $\pm$ 3.2 per cent over the 3 au to 10 000 au separation range. The companion separation distribution is observed to rise to a higher frequency at smaller separations, peaking at closer separations than measured for more massive primaries. The mass ratio distribution across the q = 0.2-1.0 range is flat, similar to that of multiple systems with solar-type primaries. The characterization of binary and multiple star frequency for low-mass field stars can provide crucial comparisons with star-forming environments and hold implications for the frequency and evolutionary histories of their associated discs and planets.},

	abstract = {We present optical and near-infrared adaptive optics (AO) imaging and spectroscopy of 13 ultracool (>M6) companions to late-type stars (K7--M4.5), most of which have recently been identified as candidate members of nearby young moving groups (YMGs; 8--120 Myr) in the literature. Three of these are new companions identified in our AO imaging survey, and two others are confirmed to be comoving with their host stars for the first time. The inferred masses of the companions (~10--100 MJup) are highly sensitive to the ages of the primary stars; therefore we critically examine the kinematic and spectroscopic properties of each system to distinguish bona fide YMG members from old field interlopers. The new M7 substellar companion 2MASS J02155892--0929121 C (40--60 MJup) shows clear spectroscopic signs of low gravity and, hence, youth. The primary, possibly a member of the ~40 Myr Tuc-Hor moving group, is visually resolved into three components, making it a young low-mass quadruple system in a compact (≲100 AU) configuration. In addition, Li i lambda6708 absorption in the intermediate-gravity M7.5 companion 2MASS J15594729+4403595 B provides unambiguous evidence that it is young (≲200 Myr) and resides below the hydrogen-burning limit. Three new close-separation (<1") companions (2MASS J06475229--2523304 B, PYC J11519+0731 B, and GJ 4378 Ab) orbit stars previously reported as candidate YMG members, but instead are likely old (≳1 Gyr) tidally locked spectroscopic binaries without convincing kinematic associations with any known moving group. The high rate of false positives in the form of old active stars with YMG-like kinematics underscores the importance of radial velocity and parallax measurements to validate candidate young stars identified via proper motion and activity selection alone. Finally, we spectroscopically confirm the cool temperature and substellar nature of HD 23514 B, a recently discovered M8 benchmark brown dwarf orbiting the dustiest-known member of the Pleiades.

@article{Van-Eylen2015,
	abstract = {Solar system planets move on almost circular orbits. In strong contrast, many massive gas giant exoplanets travel on highly elliptical orbits, whereas the shape of the orbits of smaller, more terrestrial, exoplanets remained largely elusive. Knowing the eccentricity distribution in systems of small planets would be important as it holds information about the planet's formation and evolution, and influences its habitability. We make these measurements using photometry from the Kepler satellite and utilizing a method relying on Kepler's second law, which relates the duration of a planetary transit to its orbital eccentricity, if the stellar density is known. Our sample consists of 28 bright stars with precise asteroseismic density measurements. These stars host 74 planets with an average radius of 2.6 R⊕. We find that the eccentricity of planets in Kepler multi-planet systems is low and can be described by a Rayleigh distribution with sigma = 0.049 $\pm$ 0.013. This is in full agreement with solar system eccentricities, but in contrast to the eccentricity distributions previously derived for exoplanets from radial velocity studies. Our findings are helpful in identifying which planets are habitable because the location of the habitable zone depends on eccentricity, and to determine occurrence rates inferred for these planets because planets on circular orbits are less likely to transit. For measuring eccentricity it is crucial to detect and remove Transit Timing Variations (TTVs), and we present some previously unreported TTVs. Finally transit durations help distinguish between false positives and true planets and we use our measurements to confirm six new exoplanets.},

We recover all but two of the signals reported in a recent listing from the Exoplanet Archive resulting in 163 planet candidates associated with a sample of 104 low-mass stars. We fitted the observed light curves to transit models using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method and we have made the posterior samples publicly available to facilitate further studies. We fitted empirical transit times to individual transit signals with significantly non-linear ephemerides for accurate recovery of transit parameters and precise measuring of transit timing variations. We also provide the physical parameters for the stellar sample, including new measurements of stellar rotation, allowing the conversion of transit parameters into planet radii and orbital parameters.},

	abstract = {This paper describes the first data release of the Kepler-INT Survey (KIS) that covers a 116 deg2 region of the Cygnus and Lyra constellations. The Kepler field is the target of the most intensive search for transiting planets to date. Despite the fact that the Kepler mission provides superior time-series photometry, with an enormous impact on all areas of stellar variability, its field lacks optical photometry complete to the confusion limit of the Kepler instrument necessary for selecting various classes of targets. For this reason, we follow the observing strategy and data reduction method used in the IPHAS and UVEX galactic plane surveys in order to produce a deep optical survey of the Kepler field. This initial release concerns data taken between 2011 May and August, using the Isaac Newton Telescope on the island of La Palma. Four broadband filters were used, U, g, r, i, as well as one narrowband one, Halpha, reaching down to a 10sigma limit of ~20th mag in the Vega system. Observations covering ~50 deg2, thus about half of the field, passed our quality control thresholds and constitute this first data release. We derive a global photometric calibration by placing the KIS magnitudes as close as possible to the Kepler Input Catalog (KIC) photometry. The initial data release catalog containing around 6 million sources from all the good photometric fields is available for download from the KIS Web site (www.astro.warwick.ac.uk/research/kis/) as well as via MAST (KIS magnitudes can be retrieved using the MAST enhanced target search page http://archive.stsci.edu/kepler/kepler_fov/search.php and also via Casjobs at MAST Web site http://mastweb.stsci.edu/kplrcasjobs/).},

	abstract = {Kepler provides light curves of 156,000 stars with unprecedented precision. However, the raw data as they come from the spacecraft contain significant systematic and stochastic errors. These errors, which include discontinuities, systematic trends, and outliers, obscure the astrophysical signals in the light curves. To correct these errors is the task of the Presearch Data Conditioning (PDC) module of the Kepler data analysis pipeline. The original version of PDC in Kepler did not meet the extremely high performance requirements for the detection of miniscule planet transits or highly accurate analysis of stellar activity and rotation. One particular deficiency was that astrophysical features were often removed as a side effect of the removal of errors. In this article we introduce the completely new and significantly improved version of PDC which was implemented in Kepler SOC version 8.0. This new PDC version, which utilizes a Bayesian approach for removal of systematics, reliably corrects errors in the light curves while at the same time preserving planet transits and other astrophysically interesting signals. We describe the architecture and the algorithms of this new PDC module, show typical errors encountered in Kepler data, and illustrate the corrections using real light curve examples.},

	abstract = {From common proper motion and signatures of youth, researchers have identified about 30 members of a putative TW Hydrae Association. Only four of these had parallactic distances from Hipparcos. We have measured parallaxes and proper motions for 14 primary members. We combine these with literature values of radial velocities to show that the Galactic space motions of the stars, with the exception of TWA 9 and 22, are parallel and do not indicate convergence at a common formation point sometime in the last few million years. The space motions of TWA 9 and 22 do not agree with the others and indicate that they are not TWA members. The median parallax is 18 mas or 56 pc. We further analyze the stars' absolute magnitudes on pre-main-sequence evolutionary tracks and find a range of ages with a median of 10.1 Myr and no correlation between age and Galactic location. The TWA stars may have formed from an extended and filamentary molecular cloud but are not necessarily precisely coeval.},

@article{Ducourant2014,
	abstract = {Context. The nearby TW Hydrae association (TWA) is currently a benchmark for the study of the formation and evolution of young low-mass stars, circumstellar disks, and the imaging detection of planetary companions. For these studies, it is crucial to evaluate the distance to group members in order to access their physical properties. Membership of several stars is strongly debated and age estimates vary from one author to another with doubts about coevality.  Aims: We revisit the kinematic properties of the TWA in light of new trigonometric parallaxes and proper motions to derive the dynamical age of the association and physical parameters of kinematic members.  Methods: Using observations performed with the New Technology Telescope (NTT) from ESO we measured trigonometric parallaxes and proper motions for 13 stars in TWA.  Results: With the convergent point method we identify a co-moving group with 31 TWA stars. We deduce kinematic distances for seven members of the moving group that lack trigonometric parallaxes. A traceback strategy is applied to the stellar space motions of a selection of 16 of the co-moving objects with accurate and reliable data yielding a dynamical age for the association of t ~= 7.5 $\pm$ 0.7 Myr. Using our new parallaxes and photometry available in the literature we derive stellar ages and masses from theoretical evolutionary models.  Conclusions: With new parallax and proper motion measurements from this work and current astrometric catalogs we provide an improved and accurate database for TWA stars to be used in kinematical analysis. We conclude that the dynamical age obtained via traceback strategy is consistent with previous age estimates for the TWA, and is also compatible with the average ages derived in the present paper from evolutionary models for pre-main-sequence stars.  Based on observations performed at the European Southern Observatory, Chile (79.C-0229, 81.C-0143, 82.C-0103, 83.C-0102, 84.C-0014).},

Most of these systems have saturated X-ray emission (log (LX /L bol) > -3.5) based on X-ray fluxes from the ROSAT All-Sky Survey, and many are significantly more luminous than main-sequence stars of comparable color. We present parallaxes and proper motions, Johnson-Kron-Cousins VRI photometry, and multiplicity observations from the CTIOPI program on the CTIO 0.9 m telescope. To this we add low-resolution optical spectroscopy and line measurements from the CTIO 1.5 m telescope, and interferometric binary measurements from the Hubble Space Telescope Fine Guidance Sensors. We also incorporate data from published sources: JHKS photometry from the Two Micron All Sky Survey point source catalog, X-ray data from the ROSAT All-Sky Survey, and radial velocities from literature sources. Within the sample of 45 systems, we identify 21 candidate low-mass pre-main-sequence members of nearby associations, including members of beta Pictoris, TW Hydrae, Argus, AB Doradus, two ambiguous ≈30 Myr old systems, and one object that may be a member of the Ursa Major moving group. Of the 21 candidate young systems, 14 are newly identified as a result of this work, and six of those are within 25 pc of the Sun.},

	abstract = {We present the results of a survey for stellar and substellar companions to 82 young stars in the nearby OB association Upper Scorpius. This survey used nonredundant aperture mask interferometry to achieve typical contrast limits of DeltaK~5-6 at the diffraction limit, revealing 12 new binary companions that lay below the detection limits of traditional high-resolution imaging; we also summarize a complementary snapshot imaging survey that discovered seven directly resolved companions. The overall frequency of binary companions (~35+5-4% at separations of 6-435 AU) appears to be equivalent to field stars of similar mass, but companions could be more common among lower mass stars than for the field. The companion mass function has statistically significant differences compared to several suggested mass functions for the field, and we suggest an alternate lognormal parameterization of the mass function. Our survey limits encompass the entire brown dwarf mass range, but we only detected a single companion that might be a brown dwarf; this deficit resembles the so-called brown dwarf desert that has been observed by radial velocity planet searches. Finally, our survey's deep detection limits extend into the top of the planetary mass function, reaching 8-12 MJup for half of our sample. We have not identified any planetary companions at high confidence (>~99.5%), but we have identified four candidate companions at lower confidence (>~97.5%) that merit additional follow-up to confirm or disprove their existence.},

These improvements are made possible by refining our astrometric reference frame with a new geometric optical distortion model for the W. M.

For the first time, this distortion model is constructed from on-sky measurements and is made available to the public in the form of FITS files. When applied to widely dithered images, it produces residuals in the separations of stars that are a factor of ~3 smaller compared with the outcome using previous models. By applying this new model, along with corrections for differential atmospheric refraction, to widely dithered images of SiO masers at the Galactic center (GC), we improve our ability to tie into the precisely measured radio Sgr A*-rest frame. The resulting infrared reference frame is ~2-3 times more accurate and stable than earlier published efforts. In this reference frame, Sgr A* is localized to within a position of 0.6 mas and a velocity of 0.09 mas yr-1, or ~3.4 km s-1 at 8 kpc (1sigma). Also, proper motions for members of the central stellar cluster are more accurate, although less precise, due to the limited number of these wide field measurements. These proper motion measurements show that, with respect to Sgr A*, the central stellar cluster has no rotation in the plane of the sky to within 0.3 mas yr-1 arcsec-1, has no net translational motion with respect to Sgr A* to within 0.1 mas yr-1, and has net rotation perpendicular to the plane of the sky along the Galactic plane, as has previously been observed. While earlier proper motion studies defined a reference frame by assuming no net motion of the stellar cluster, this approach is fundamentally limited by the cluster's intrinsic dispersion and therefore will not improve with time. We define a reference frame with SiO masers and this reference frame's stability should improve steadily with future measurements of the SiO masers in this region (vpropt -3/2). This is essential for achieving the necessary reference frame stability required to detect the effects of general relativity and extended mass on short-period stars at the GC.},

	abstract = {We present a near-infrared (0.9-2.4 mum) spectroscopic study of 73 field ultracool dwarfs having spectroscopic and/or kinematic evidence of youth (≈10-300 Myr). Our sample is composed of 48 low-resolution (R ≈ 100) spectra and 41 moderate-resolution spectra (R >~ 750-2000). First, we establish a method for spectral typing M5-L7 dwarfs at near-IR wavelengths that is independent of gravity. We find that both visual and index-based classification in the near-IR provides consistent spectral types with optical spectral types, though with a small systematic offset in the case of visual classification at J and K band. Second, we examine features in the spectra of ~10 Myr ultracool dwarfs to define a set of gravity-sensitive indices based on FeH, VO, K I, Na I, and H-band continuum shape. We then create an index-based method for classifying the gravities of M6-L5 dwarfs that provides consistent results with gravity classifications from optical spectroscopy. Our index-based classification can distinguish between young and dusty objects. Guided by the resulting classifications, we propose a set of low-gravity spectral standards for the near-IR. Finally, we estimate the ages corresponding to our gravity classifications.},

	abstract = {A significant population of stars with ages younger than the Pleiades exists in the solar neighborhood. They are grouped in loose young associations, sharing similar kinematical and physical properties, but, due to their vicinity to the Sun, they are dispersed in the sky, and hard to identify.  Their strong stellar coronal activity, causing enhanced X-ray emission, allows them to be identified as counterparts of X-ray sources.  The analysis presented here is based mainly on the SACY project, aimed to survey in a systematic way counterparts of ROSAT all-sky X-ray sources in the Southern Hemisphere for which proper motions are known.  We give the definition, main properties, and lists of high-probability members of nine confirmed loose young associations that do not belong directly to the well-known Oph-Sco-Cen complex.  The youth and vicinity of many members of these new associations make them ideal targets for follow-up studies, specifically geared towards the understanding of planetary system formation.  Searches for very low-mass and brown dwarf companions are ongoing, and it will be promising to search for planetary companions with next generation instruments.},

	abstract = {We present 2.12-2.23 mum high contrast integral field spectroscopy of the extrasolar planet HR 8799 b. Our observations were obtained with OSIRIS on the Keck II telescope and sample the 2.2 mum CH4 feature, which is useful for spectral classification and as a temperature diagnostic for ultracool objects. The spectrum of HR 8799 b is relatively featureless, with little or no methane absorption, and does not exhibit the strong CH4 seen in T dwarfs of similar absolute magnitudes. The spectrum is consistent with field objects from early-L to T4 (3sigma confidence level), with a best-fitting type of T2. A similar analysis of the published 1-4 mum photometry shows the infrared spectral energy distribution (SED) matches L5-L8 field dwarfs, especially the reddest known objects which are believed to be young and/or very dusty. Overall, we find that HR 8799 b has a spectral type consistent with L5-T2, although its SED is atypical compared to most field objects. We fit the 2.2 mum spectrum and the infrared SED using the Hubeny & Burrows, Burrows et al., and Ames-Dusty model atmosphere grids, which incorporate non-equilibrium chemistry, non-solar metallicities, and clear and cloudy variants. No models agree with all of the data, but those with intermediate clouds produce significantly better fits. The largest discrepancy occurs in the J band, which is highly suppressed in HR 8799 b. Models with high eddy diffusion coefficients and high metallicities are somewhat preferred over those with equilibrium chemistry and solar metallicity. The best-fitting effective temperatures range from 1300 to 1700 K with radii between ~0.3 and 0.5 R Jup. These values are inconsistent with evolutionary model-derived values of 800-900 K and 1.1-1.3 R Jup based on the luminosity of HR 8799 b and the age of HR 8799, a discrepancy that probably results from imperfect atmospheric models or the limited range of physical parameters covered by the models. The low temperature inferred from evolutionary models indicates that HR 8799 b is ~400 K cooler than field L/T transition objects, providing further evidence that the L/T transition is gravity-dependent. With an unusually dusty photosphere, an exceptionally low luminosity for its spectral type, and hints of extreme secondary physical parameters, HR 8799 b appears to be unlike any class of field brown dwarf currently known.  The data presented herein were obtained at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated as a scientific partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of California, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The Observatory was made possible by the generous financial support of the W. M. Keck Foundation.},

	abstract = {Direct imaging of exoplanetary systems is a powerful technique that can reveal Jupiter-like planets in wide orbits, can enable detailed characterization of planetary atmospheres, and is a key step toward imaging Earth-like planets. Imaging detections are challenging because of the combined effect of small angular separation and large luminosity contrast between a planet and its host star. High-contrast observations with the Keck and Gemini telescopes have revealed three planets orbiting the star HR 8799, with projected separations of 24, 38, and 68 astronomical units. Multi-epoch data show counter clockwise orbital motion for all three imaged planets. The low luminosity of the companions and the estimated age of the system imply planetary masses between 5 and 13 times that of Jupiter. This system resembles a scaled-up version of the outer portion of our solar system.},

	abstract = {We present a new method based on a Bayesian analysis to identify new members of nearby young kinematic groups. The analysis minimally takes into account the position, proper motion, magnitude, and color of a star, but other observables can be readily added (e.g., radial velocity, distance). We use this method to find new young low-mass stars in the beta Pictoris and AB Doradus moving groups and in the TW Hydrae, Tucana-Horologium, Columba, Carina, and Argus associations. Starting from a sample of 758 mid-K to mid-M (K5V-M5V) stars showing youth indicators such as Halpha and X-ray emission, our analysis yields 214 new highly probable low-mass members of the kinematic groups analyzed. One is in TW Hydrae, 37 in beta Pictoris, 17 in Tucana-Horologium, 20 in Columba, 6 in Carina, 50 in Argus, 32 in AB Doradus, and the remaining 51 candidates are likely young but have an ambiguous membership to more than one association. The false alarm rate for new candidates is estimated to be 5% for beta Pictoris and TW Hydrae, 10% for Tucana-Horologium, Columba, Carina, and Argus, and 14% for AB Doradus. Our analysis confirms the membership of 58 stars proposed in the literature. Firm membership confirmation of our new candidates will require measurement of their radial velocity (predicted by our analysis), parallax, and lithium 6708 {\AA} equivalent width. We have initiated these follow-up observations for a number of candidates, and we have identified two stars (2MASSJ01112542+1526214, 2MASSJ05241914-1601153) as very strong candidate members of the beta Pictoris moving group and one strong candidate member (2MASSJ05332558-5117131) of the Tucana-Horologium association; these three stars have radial velocity measurements confirming their membership and lithium detections consistent with young age.

	abstract = {Based on high-resolution spectra obtained with PHOENIX at Gemini-South, CRIRES at VLT-UT1, and ESPaDOnS at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope, we present new measurements of the radial and projected rotational velocities of 219 low-mass stars. The target likely membership was initially established using the Bayesian analysis tool recently presented in Malo et al., taking into account only the position, proper motion, and photometry of the stars to assess their membership probability. In the present study, we include radial velocity as an additional input to our analysis, and in doing so we confirm the high membership probability for 130 candidates: 27 in beta Pictoris, 22 in Tucana-Horologium, 25 in Columba, 7 in Carina, 18 in Argus and 18 in AB Doradus, and 13 with an ambiguous membership. Our analysis also confirms the membership of 57 stars proposed in the literature. A subsample of 16 candidates was observed at 3 or more epochs, allowing us to discover 6 new spectroscopic binaries. The fraction of binaries in our sample is 25%, consistent with values in the literature. Of the stars in our sample, 20% show projected rotational velocities (vsin i) higher than 30 km s-1 and therefore are considered as fast rotators. A parallax and other youth indicators are still needed to fully confirm the 130 highly probable candidates identified here as new bona fide members. Finally, based on the X-ray emission of bona fide and highly probable group members, we show that for low-mass stars in the 12-120 Myr age range, the X-ray luminosity is an excellent indicator of youth and better than the more traditionally used R X parameter, the ratio of X-ray to bolometric luminosity.},

	abstract = {We present the BANYAN All-Sky Survey (BASS) catalog, consisting of 228 new late-type (M4-L6) candidate members of nearby young moving groups (YMGs) with an expected false-positive rate of ~13%. This sample includes 79 new candidate young brown dwarfs and 22 planetary-mass objects. These candidates were identified through the first systematic all-sky survey for late-type low-mass stars and brown dwarfs in YMGs. We cross-matched the Two Micron All Sky Survey and AllWISE catalogs outside of the galactic plane to build a sample of 98,970 potential >=M5 dwarfs in the solar neighborhood and calculated their proper motions with typical precisions of 5-15 mas yr-1. We selected highly probable candidate members of several YMGs from this sample using the Bayesian Analysis for Nearby Young AssociatioNs II tool (BANYAN II). We used the most probable statistical distances inferred from BANYAN II to estimate the spectral type and mass of these candidate YMG members. We used this unique sample to show tentative signs of mass segregation in the AB Doradus moving group and the Tucana-Horologium and Columba associations. The BASS sample has already been successful in identifying several new young brown dwarfs in earlier publications, and will be of great interest in studying the initial mass function of YMGs and for the search of exoplanets by direct imaging; the input sample of potential close-by >=M5 dwarfs will be useful to study the kinematics of low-mass stars and brown dwarfs and search for new proper motion pairs.},

	abstract = {We present results from a high-contrast adaptive optics imaging search for giant planets and brown dwarfs (gsim1 M Jup) around 122 newly identified nearby (lsim40 pc) young M dwarfs. Half of our targets are younger than 135 Myr and 90% are younger than the Hyades (620 Myr). After removing 44 close stellar binaries (implying a stellar companion fraction of >35.4% $\pm$ 4.3% within 100 AU), 27 of which are new or spatially resolved for the first time, our remaining sample of 78 single M dwarfs makes this the largest imaging search for planets around young low-mass stars (0.1-0.6 M &sun;) to date. Our H- and K-band coronagraphic observations with Keck/NIRC2 and Subaru/HiCIAO achieve typical contrasts of 12-14 mag and 9-13 mag at 1'', respectively, which correspond to limiting planet masses of 0.5-10 M Jup at 5-33 AU for 85% of our sample. We discovered four young brown dwarf companions: 1RXS J235133.3+312720 B (32 $\pm$ 6 M Jup; L0+2-1; 120 $\pm$ 20 AU), GJ 3629 B (64+30-23 M Jup; M7.5 $\pm$ 0.5; 6.5 $\pm$ 0.5 AU), 1RXS J034231.8+121622 B (35 $\pm$ 8 M Jup; L0 $\pm$ 1; 19.8 $\pm$ 0.9 AU), and 2MASS J15594729+4403595 B (43 $\pm$ 9 M Jup; M8.0 $\pm$ 0.5; 190 $\pm$ 20 AU). Over 150 candidate planets were identified; we obtained follow-up imaging for 56% of these but all are consistent with background stars. Our null detection of planets enables strong statistical constraints on the occurrence rate of long-period giant planets around single M dwarfs. We infer an upper limit (at the 95% confidence level) of 10.3% and 16.0% for 1-13 M Jup planets between 10-100 AU for hot-start and cold-start (Fortney) evolutionary models, respectively. Fewer than 6.0% (9.9%) of M dwarfs harbor massive gas giants in the 5-13 M Jup range like those orbiting HR 8799 and beta Pictoris between 10-100 AU for a hot-start (cold-start) formation scenario. The frequency of brown dwarf (13-75 M Jup) companions to single M dwarfs between 10-100 AU is 2.8+2.4-1.5%. Altogether we find that giant planets, especially massive ones, are rare in the outskirts of M dwarf planetary systems. Although the first directly imaged planets were found around massive stars, there is currently no statistical evidence for a trend of giant planet frequency with stellar host mass at large separations as predicted by the disk instability model of giant planet formation.

Keck Observatory, which is operated as a scientific partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of California and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

	abstract = {We present the discovery of a 0.2" companion to the young M dwarf GJ 3629 as part of our high-contrast adaptive optics imaging search for giant planets around low-mass stars with the Keck-II and Subaru telescopes. Two epochs of imaging confirm that the pair is comoving and reveal signs of orbital motion. The primary exhibits saturated X-ray emission which, together with its UV photometry from GALEX, points to an age younger than ~300 Myr. At these ages the companion lies below the hydrogen burning limit with a model-dependent mass of 46 $\pm$ 16 M Jup based on the system's photometric distance of 22 $\pm$ 3 pc. Resolved YJHK photometry of the pair indicates a spectral type of M7 $\pm$ 2 for GJ 3629 B. With a projected separation of 4.4 $\pm$ 0.6 AU and an estimated orbital period of 21 $\pm$ 5 yr, GJ 3629 AB is likely to yield a dynamical mass in the next several years, making it one of only a handful of brown dwarfs to have a measured mass and an age constrained from the stellar primary.

	abstract = {We confirm and characterize the exoplanetary systems Kepler-445 and Kepler-446: two mid-M dwarf stars, each with multiple, small, short-period transiting planets. Kepler-445 is a metal-rich ([Fe/H] = +0.25 $\pm$ 0.10) M4 dwarf with three transiting planets, and Kepler-446 is a metal-poor ([Fe/H] = --0.30 $\pm$ 0.10) M4 dwarf also with three transiting planets. Kepler-445c is similar to GJ 1214b: both in planetary radius and the properties of the host star. The Kepler-446 system is similar to the Kepler-42 system: both are metal-poor with large galactic space velocities and three short-period, likely rocky transiting planets that were initially assigned erroneously large planet-to-star radius ratios. We independently determined stellar parameters from spectroscopy and searched for and fitted the transit light curves for the planets, imposing a strict prior on stellar density in order to remove correlations between the fitted impact parameter and planet-to-star radius ratio for short-duration transits. Combining Kepler-445, Kepler-446, and Kepler-42, and isolating all mid-M dwarf stars observed by Kepler with the precision necessary to detect similar systems, we calculate that 21+7-5% of mid-M dwarf stars host compact multiples (multiple planets with periods of less than 10 days) for a wide range of metallicities. We suggest that the inferred planet masses for these systems support highly efficient accretion of protoplanetary disk metals by mid-M dwarf protoplanets.},

	abstract = {LP 876-10 is a nearby active M4 dwarf in Aquarius at a distance of 7.6 pc. The star is a new addition to the 10 pc census, with a parallax measured via the REsearch Consortium On Nearby Stars (RECONS) astrometric survey on the Small and Moderate Aperture Research Telescope System's 0.9 m telescope. We demonstrate that the astrometry, radial velocity, and photometric data for LP 876-10 are consistent with the star being a third bound stellar component to the Fomalhaut multiple system, despite the star lying nearly 6$\,^{\circ}$ away from Fomalhaut A in the sky. The three-dimensional separation of LP 876-10 from Fomalhaut is only 0.77 $\pm$ 0.01 pc, and 0.987 $\pm$ 0.006 pc from TW PsA (Fomalhaut B), well within the estimated tidal radius of the Fomalhaut system (1.9 pc). LP 876-10 shares the motion of Fomalhaut within ~1 km s-1, and we estimate an interloper probability of ~10-5. Neither our echelle spectroscopy nor astrometry are able to confirm the close companion to LP 876-10 reported in the Washington Double Star Catalog (WSI 138). We argue that the Castor Moving Group to which the Fomalhaut system purportedly belongs, is likely to be a dynamical stream, and hence membership to the group does not provide useful age constraints for group members. LP 876-10 (Fomalhaut C) has now risen from obscurity to become a rare example of a field M dwarf with well-constrained age (440 $\pm$ 40 Myr) and metallicity. Besides harboring a debris disk system and candidate planet, Fomalhaut now has two of the widest known stellar companions.},

	abstract = {Based on high-resolution optical spectra obtained with ESPaDOnS at Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope, we determine fundamental parameters (T eff, R, L bol, log g,  and metallicity) for 59 candidate members of nearby young kinematic groups. The candidates were identified through the BANYAN Bayesian inference method of Malo et al., which takes into account the position, proper motion, magnitude, color, radial velocity, and parallax (when available) to establish a membership probability. The derived parameters are compared to Dartmouth magnetic evolutionary models and field stars with the goal of constraining the age of our candidates. We find that, in general, low-mass stars in our sample are more luminous and have inflated radii compared to older stars, a trend expected for pre-main-sequence stars. The Dartmouth magnetic evolutionary models show a good fit to observations of field K and M stars, assuming a magnetic field strength of a few kG, as typically observed for cool stars. Using the low-mass members of the beta Pictoris moving group, we have re-examined the age inconsistency problem between lithium depletion age and isochronal age (Hertzspring-Russell diagram). We find that the inclusion of the magnetic field in evolutionary models increases the isochronal age estimates for the K5V-M5V stars. Using these models and field strengths, we derive an average isochronal age between 15 and 28 Myr and we confirm a clear lithium depletion boundary from which an age of 26 $\pm$ 3 Myr is derived, consistent with previous age estimates based on this method.},

	abstract = {We investigate the use of the gravity sensitive neutral sodium (Na I) doublet at 8183 {\AA} and 8195 {\AA} (Na 8200 {\AA} doublet) as an age indicator for M dwarfs. We measured the Na doublet equivalent width (EW) in giants, old dwarfs, young dwarfs, and candidate members of the beta Pic moving group using medium-resolution spectra. Our Na 8200 {\AA} doublet EW analysis shows that the feature is useful as an approximate age indicator in M-type dwarfs with (V - K s  ) >= 5.0, reliably distinguishing stars older and younger than 100 Myr. A simple derivation of the dependence of the Na EW on temperature and gravity supports the observational results. An analysis of the effects of metallicity shows that this youth indicator is best used on samples with similar metallicity. The age estimation technique presented here becomes useful in a mass regime where traditional youth indicators are increasingly less reliable, is applicable to other alkali lines, and will help identify new low-mass members in other young clusters and associations.},

	abstract = {We report the selection and spectroscopic confirmation of 129 new late-type (SpT = K3-M6) members of the Tucana-Horologium moving group, a nearby (d ~ 40 pc), young (tau ~ 40 Myr) population of comoving stars. We also report observations for 13 of the 17 known Tuc-Hor members in this spectral type range, and that 62 additional candidates are likely to be unassociated field stars; the confirmation frequency for new candidates is therefore 129/191 = 67%. We have used radial velocities, Halpha emission, and Li6708 absorption to distinguish between contaminants and bona fide members. Our expanded census of Tuc-Hor increases the known population by a factor of ~3 in total and by a factor of ~8 for members with SpT >= K3, but even so, the K-M dwarf population of Tuc-Hor is still markedly incomplete. Our expanded census allows for a much more detailed study of Tuc-Hor than was previously feasible. The spatial distribution of members appears to trace a two-dimensional sheet, with a broad distribution in X and Y, but a very narrow distribution ($\pm$5 pc) in Z. The corresponding velocity distribution is very small, with a scatter of $\pm$1.1 km s-1 about the mean UVW velocity for stars spanning the entire 50 pc extent of Tuc-Hor. We also show that the isochronal age (tau ~ 20-30 Myr) and the lithium depletion boundary age (tau ~ 40 Myr) disagree, following the trend in other pre-main-sequence populations for isochrones to yield systematically younger ages. The Halpha emission line strength follows a trend of increasing equivalent width with later spectral type, as is seen for young clusters. We find that moving group members have been depleted of measurable lithium for spectral types of K7.0-M4.5. None of our targets have significant infrared excesses in the WISE W3 band, yielding an upper limit on warm debris disks of F < 0.7%. Finally, our purely kinematic and color-magnitude selection procedure allows us to test the efficiency and completeness for activity-based selection of young stars. We find that 60% of K-M dwarfs in Tuc-Hor do not have ROSAT counterparts and would have been omitted in X-ray-selected samples. In contrast, GALEX UV-selected samples using a previously suggested criterion for youth achieve completeness of 77% and purity of 78%, and we suggest new SpT-dependent selection criteria that will yield >95% completeness for tau ~ 40 Myr populations with GALEX data available.},

@article{Mann2015a,
	abstract = {Estimating accurate bolometric fluxes for stars requires reliable photometry to absolutely flux calibrate the spectra. This is a significant problem for studies of very bright stars, which are generally saturated in modern photometric surveys. Instead we must rely on photometry with less precise calibration. We utilize precisely flux-calibrated spectra to derive improved filter bandpasses and zero points for the most common sources of photometry for bright stars. In total, we test 39 different filters in the General Catalog of Photometric Data as well as those from Tycho-2 and Hipparcos. We show that utilizing inaccurate filter profiles from the literature can create significant color terms resulting in fluxes that deviate by ≳10% from actual values. To remedy this we employ an empirical approach; we iteratively adjust the literature filter profile and zero point, convolve it with catalog spectra, and compare to the corresponding flux from the photometry. We adopt the passband values that produce the best agreement between photometry and spectroscopy and are independent of stellar color. We find that while most zero points change by < 5%, a few systems change by 10-15%. Our final profiles and zero points are similar to recent estimates from the literature. Based on determinations of systematic errors in our selected spectroscopic libraries, we estimate that most of our improved zero points are accurate to 0.5-1%.},

The concept of SNIFS is to split the 6" x 6" field of view into 225 samples of 0.4" x 0.4" through a microlens array. Then the spectral decomposition of each sample is imaged on a 2k x 4k CCD. In order to cover all the large spectral range with a high resolution, the spectrograph is composed of two modules, one for the blue wavelengths (320 nm to 560nm)with a resolution around 1000 at 430 nm and one for the red wavelengths (520 nm to 1 µm) with a resolution around 1300 at 760 nm. First we will present the optical design and detail the function of each optical component. Then the mechanical design will be shown with some maps of the structure.

The Snfactory will discover and obtain frequent lightcurve spectrophotometry covering 3200-10000{\AA} for roughly 300 Type Ia supernovae at the low-redshift end of the smooth Hubble flow. The quantity, quality, breadth of galactic environments, and homogeneous nature of the Snfactory dataset will make it the premier source of calibration for the Type Ia supernova width-brightness relation and the intrinsic supernova colors used for K-correction and correction for extinction by host-galaxy dust. This dataset will also allow an extensive investigation of additional parameters which possibly influence the quality of Type Ia supernovae as cosmological probes. The Snfactory search capabilities and follow-up instrumentation include wide-field CCD imagers on two 1.2-m telescopes (via collaboration with the Near Earth Asteroid Tracking team at JPL and the QUEST team at Yale), and a two-channel integral-field-unit optical spectrograph/imager being fabricated for the University of Hawaii 2.2-m telescope. In addition to ground-based follow-up, UV spectra for a subsample of these supernovae will be obtained with HST. The pipeline to obtain, transfer via wireless and standard internet, and automatically process the search images is in operation. Software and hardware development is now underway to enable the execution of follow-up spectroscopy of supernova candidates at the Hawaii 2.2-m telescope via automated remote control of the telescope and the IFU spectrograph/imager.},

	abstract = {We present new BVIC photometry for 350 Pleiades proper motion members with 9 < V <~ 17. Importantly, our new catalog includes a large number of K- and early M-type stars, roughly doubling the number of low-mass stars with well-calibrated Johnson/Cousins photometry in this benchmark cluster. We combine our new photometry with existing photometry from the literature to define a purely empirical isochrone at Pleiades age (≈100 Myr) extending from V = 9 to 17. We use the empirical isochrone to identify 48 new probable binaries and 14 likely nonmembers. The photometrically identified single stars are compared against their expected positions in the color-magnitude diagram (CMD). At 100 Myr, the mid K and early M stars are predicted to lie above the zero-age main sequence (ZAMS) having not yet reached the ZAMS. We find in the B - V versus V CMD that mid K and early M dwarfs are instead displaced below (or blueward of) the ZAMS. Using the stars' previously reported rotation periods, we find a highly statistically significant correlation between rotation period and CMD displacement, in the sense that the more rapidly rotating stars have the largest displacements in the B - V CMD.},

	abstract = {In this paper we present surveys of two open clusters using photometry and accurate astrometry from the SuperCOSMOS microdensitometer. These use plates taken by the Palomar Oschin Schmidt Telescope giving a wide field (5$\,^{\circ}$ from the cluster centre in both cases), accurate positions and a long time baseline for the proper motions. Distribution functions are fitted to proper motion vector point diagrams yielding formal membership probabilities. Luminosity and mass functions are then produced along with a catalogue of high probability members. Background star contamination limited the depth of the study of Alpha Per to R=18. Due to this the mass function found for this cluster could only be fitted with a power law (xi(m) = m-alpha) with alpha=0.86+0.14-0.19. However with the better seperation of the Pleiades' cluster proper motion from the field population results were obtained down to R=21. As the mass function produced for this cluster extends to lower masses it is possible to see the gradient becoming increasingly shallow. This mass function is well fitted by a log normal distribution.

	abstract = {Aims: On the basis of the PPMXL catalogue we perform an all-sky census of the Hyades down to masses of about 0.2 m&sun; in a region up to 30 pc from the cluster centre.  Methods: We use the proper motions from PPMXL in the convergent point method to determine probable kinematic members. From 2MASS photometry and CMC14 r'-band photometry, we derive empirical colour-absolute magnitude diagrams and, finally, determine photometric membership for all kinematic candidates.  Results: This is the first deep (r' <= 17) all-sky survey of the Hyades allowing a full three-dimensional analysis of the cluster. The survey is complete down to at least MKs = 7.3 or 0.25 m&sun;. We find 724 stellar systems co-moving with the bulk Hyades space velocity, which represent a total mass of 435 m&sun;. The tidal radius is about 9 pc, and 275 m&sun; (364 systems) are gravitationally bound. This is the cluster proper. Its mass density profile is perfectly fitted by a Plummer model with a central density of 2.21 m&sun; pc-3 and a core radius of rco = 3.10 pc, while the half-mass radius is rh = 4.1 pc. There are another 100 m&sun; in a volume between one and two tidal radii (halo), and another 60 m&sun; up to a distance of 30 pc from the centre. Strong mass segregation is inherent in the cluster. The present-day luminosity and mass functions are noticeably different in various parts of the cluster (core, corona, halo, and co-movers). They are strongly evolved compared to presently favoured initial mass functions. The analysis of the velocity dispersion of the cluster shows that about 20% of its members must be binaries. As a by-product, we find that presently available theoretical isochrones are not able to adequately describe the near-infrared colour-absolute magnitude relation for those cluster stars that are less massive than about 0.6 m&sun;.

	abstract = {We present results from our on-going program to directly measure the sizes of nearby young stars using the CHARA Array interferometer. Here we highlight several recent successes, including a precise size measurement of AU Mic (GJ 803), a M1 spectral type star that harbors a debris disk and is a member of the Beta Pictoris Moving Group. The star is spatially resolved with an angular diameter of 0.78 milli-arcseconds, corresponding to a physical radius of 0.83 solar radii; the measurement is accurate to better than 3 percent, which is especially remarkable given the low elevation of this star when observed from the northern hemisphere (DEC = -31 degrees). This size is roughly 70% larger than the average size of similar temperature main sequence stars, also determined from interferometric measurements. It is a bona-fide pre-main sequence star, and the first such low mass star ever spatially resolved. The results provide an independent age estimate of the Moving Group, a temporal stamp on the evolutionary state of the debris disk, and offer a benchmark for theories of how low mass stars gravitationally settle toward the main sequence.},

@article{Newton2015A,
	abstract = {Interferometric radius measurements provide a direct probe of the fundamental parameters of M dwarfs. However, interferometry is within reach for only a limited sample of nearby, bright stars. We use interferometrically measured radii, bolometric luminosities, and effective temperatures to develop new empirical calibrations based on low-resolution, near-infrared spectra. We find that H-band Mg and Al spectral features are good tracers of stellar properties, and derive functions that relate effective temperature, radius, and log luminosity to these features. The standard deviations in the residuals of our best fits are, respectively, 73 K, 0.027 R ☉, and 0.049 dex (an 11% error on luminosity). Our calibrations are valid from mid K to mid M dwarf stars, roughly corresponding to temperatures between 3100 and 4800 K. We apply our H-band relationships to M dwarfs targeted by the MEarth transiting planet survey and to the cool Kepler Objects of Interest (KOIs). We present spectral measurements and estimated stellar parameters for these stars. Parallaxes are also available for many of the MEarth targets, allowing us to independently validate our calibrations by demonstrating a clear relationship between our inferred parameters and the stars' absolute K magnitudes. We identify objects with magnitudes that are too bright for their inferred luminosities as candidate multiple systems. We also use our estimated luminosities to address the applicability of near-infrared metallicity calibrations to mid and late M dwarfs. The temperatures we infer for the KOIs agree remarkably well with those from the literature; however, our stellar radii are systematically larger than those presented in previous works that derive radii from model isochrones. This results in a mean planet radius that is 15% larger than one would infer using the stellar properties from recent catalogs. Our results confirm the derived parameters from previous in-depth studies of KOIs 961 (Kepler-42), 254 (Kepler-45), and 571 (Kepler-186), the latter of which hosts a rocky planet orbiting in its star's habitable zone.},

These data are used to examine the kinematics of the stars at the bottom of the hydrogen-burning main sequence. No evidence is found for a significant difference between the kinematics of the stars in our sample with I-K>3.5 (M_bol>~12.8) and those of more massive M dwarfs (M_bol~7-10). A spectral atlas at high (0.4-Angstroms) resolution for M8-M9+ stars is provided, and the equivalent widths of CsI, RbI and Halpha lines present in our spectra are examined. We analyse our data to search for the presence of rapid rotation, and find that the brown dwarf LP944-20 is a member of the class of `inactive, rapid rotators'. Such objects seem to be common at and below the hydrogen-burning main sequence. It seems that in low-mass/low-temperature dwarf objects either the mechanism that heats the chromosphere, or the mechanism that generates magnetic fields, is greatly suppressed.},

	abstract = {Helioseismology has allowed us to study the structure of the Sun in unprecedented detail. One of the triumphs of the theory of stellar evolution was that helioseismic studies had shown that the structure of solar models is very similar to that of the Sun. However, this agreement has been spoiled by recent revisions of the solar heavy-element abundances. Heavy-element abundances determine the opacity of the stellar material and hence, are an important input to stellar model calculations. The models with the new, low abundances do not satisfy helioseismic constraints. We review here how heavy-element abundances affect solar models, how these models are tested with helioseismology, and the impact of the new abundances on standard solar models. We also discuss the attempts made to improve the agreement of the low-abundance models with the Sun and discuss how helioseismology is being used to determine the solar heavy-element abundances. A review of current literature shows that attempts to improve agreement between solar models with low heavy-element abundances and seismic inference have been unsuccessful so far. The low-metallicity models that have the least disagreement with seismic data require changing all input physics to stellar models beyond their acceptable ranges. Seismic determinations of the solar heavy-element abundances yield results that are consistent with the older, higher values of the solar abundance, and hence, no major changes to the inputs to solar models are required to make higher-metallicity solar models consistent with the helioseismic data.},

	abstract = {Ground-based astronomical spectra are contaminated by the Earth's atmosphere to varying degrees in all spectral regions. We present a Python code that can accurately fit a model to the telluric absorption spectrum present in astronomical data, with residuals of ~3%-5% of the continuum for moderately strong lines. We demonstrate the quality of the correction by fitting the telluric spectrum in a nearly featureless A0V star, HIP 20264, as well as to a series of dwarf M star spectra near the 819 nm sodium doublet. We directly compare the results to an empirical telluric correction of HIP 20264 and find that our model-fitting procedure is at least as good and sometimes more accurate. The telluric correction code, which we make freely available to the astronomical community, can be used as a replacement for telluric standard star observations for many purposes.},

	abstract = {Serious discrepancies have recently been observed between predictions of stellar evolution models in the 0.7-1.1 Msun mass range and accurately measured properties of binary stars with components in this mass range. We study one of these objects, the eclipsing binary UV Piscium, which is particularly interesting because Popper (\cite{popper1997}) derived age estimates for each component that differed by more than a factor of two. In an attempt to solve this significant discrepancy (a difference in age of 11 Gyr), we compute a large grid of stellar evolution models with the CESAM code for each component. By fixing the masses to their accurately determined values (relative error smaller than 1% for both stars), we consider a wide range of possible metallicities Z (0.01 to 0.05), and helium content Y (0.25 to 0.34) uncorrelated to Z. In addition, the mixing length parameter alphaMLT  is left as another free parameter. We obtain a best fit in the Teff-radius diagram for a common chemical composition (Z, Y) = (0.012, 0.31), but a different MLT parameter alphaMLT a = 0.95 +/- 0.12(statistical)+0.30(systematic) and alphaMLT b = 0.65 +/- 0.07(stat)+0.10(syst). The apparent age discrepancy found by Popper (\cite{popper1997}) disappears with this solution, the components being coeval to within 1%. This suggests that fixing alphaMLT  to its solar value ( ~ 1.6), a common hypothesis assumed in most stellar evolutionary models, may not be correct. Secondly, since alphaMLT  is smaller for the less massive component, this suggests that the alphaMLT parameter may decrease with stellar mass, showing yet another shortcoming of the mixing length theory to explain stellar convection.  This trend needs further confirmation with other binary stars with accurate data.},

@article{Metcalfe1996,
	abstract = {CM Dra is the least massive main-sequence eclipsing double-lined spectroscopic binary currently known. Consequently, this system offers a unique opportunity to test stellar structure models near the bottom of the main sequence. The orbital solution of Lacy (1977) established the masses and radii of the two components with uncertainties of a few percent, but these errors are too large to distinguish between competing models. We present a new double-lined orbital solution based on 233 echelle spectra obtained with the CfA Digital Speedometers over the past 10 yr. Radial velocities for both components were determined using TODCOR, a two-dimensional correlation technique. Using Lacy's (1977) value for orbital inclination, we derive individual masses of MA = 0.2307$\pm$0.0010 and MB = 0.2136$\pm$0.0010 Msun and a mass ratio of q = 0.9260$\pm$0.0026. Using Lacy's light-curve solution and our spectroscopic orbit we derive individual radii of RA = 0.2516$\pm$0.0020 and RB = 0.2347$\pm$0.0019 Rsun. When plotted on a mass-radius diagram, the slope defined by the two components of CM Dra agrees well with the predictions of recent models. The ability to distinguish between models is limited by the uncertainties in the radii and the metal abundance. Following the analysis of Paczynski & Sienkiewicz (1984), we derive bulk helium abundances for the two components of YA = 0.32 and YB = 0.31. The uncertainty in the difference of these two helium abundances, YA - YB, is $\pm$0.02 and depends only on the uncertainty in the ratios of the masses and radii. The uncertainty in the absolute value of these helium abundances set by the uncertainties in the luminosity (including parallax and bolometric correction), radii, ages, and masses is $\pm$0.04.  CM Dra, appears to be a member of Population II. Thus there is some promise that it will be able to provide a useful test of the primordial helium abundance.},

	abstract = {The latest solar atmosphere models including non-LTE corrections and three-dimensional hydrodynamic convection simulations predict a significant reduction in the solar metal abundance. This leads to a serious conflict between helioseismic data and the predictions of solar interiors models. We demonstrate that the helioseismic constraints on the surface convection zone depth and helium abundance combined with stellar interiors models can be used to constrain chemical composition. A detailed examination of the errors in the theoretical models disfavors strongly (disagreeing at the 15 sigma level with the seismic data) the proposed new low abundance, while the models constructed with the older and higher solar abundances are consistent (within 2 sigma). We then use the sensitivity of the seismic properties to abundance changes to invert the problem and infer a seismic solar heavy-element abundance mix with two components: meteoritic abundances and the light metals CNONe. Seismic degeneracies between the best solutions for the elements arise for changes in the relative CNONe abundances and their effects are quantified. We obtain Fe/H=7.50+/-0.045+/-0.003(CNNe) and O/H=8.86+/-0.041+/-0.025(CNNe) on the logarithmic scale, where H=12 for the relative CNNe mixtures in the Grevese & Sauval mixture; the second error term reflects the uncertainty in the overall abundance scale from errors in the C, N, and Ne abundances relative to oxygen. These are consistent within the errors with the previous standard solar mixture but in strong conflict with the low oxygen abundance inferred from the three-dimensional hydro models. Changes in the Ne abundance can mimic changes in oxygen for the purposes of scalar constraints. However, models constructed with low oxygen and high neon are inconsistent with the solar sound speed profile. Implications for the solar abundance scale are discussed.},

	abstract = {We show that standard solar models are in good agreement with the helioseismologically determined sound speed and density as a function of solar radius, the depth of the convective zone, and the surface helium abundance, as long as those models do not incorporate the most recent heavy-element abundance determinations. However, sophisticated new analyses of the solar atmosphere infer lower abundances of the lighter metals (like C, N, O, Ne, and Ar) than the previously widely used surface abundances. We show that solar models that include the lower heavy-element abundances disagree with the solar profiles of sound speed and density as well as the depth of the convective zone and the helium abundance. The disagreements for models with the new abundances range from factors of several to many times the quoted uncertainties in the helioseismological measurements. The disagreements are at temperatures that are too low to affect significantly solar neutrino emission. If errors in the calculated OPAL opacities are solely responsible for the disagreements, then the corrections in the opacity must extend from 2×106 K (R=0.7 Rsolar) to 5×106 K (R=0.4 Rsolar), with opacity increases of the order of 10%.},

GALEX is performing the first space UV sky survey, including imaging and grism surveys in two bands (1350-1750 and 1750-2750 {\AA}). The surveys include an all-sky imaging survey (mAB~=20.5), a medium imaging survey of 1000 deg2 (mAB~=23), a deep imaging survey of 100 deg2 (mAB~=25), and a nearby galaxy survey. Spectroscopic (slitless) grism surveys (R=100-200) are underway with various depths and sky coverage. Many targets overlap existing or planned surveys in other bands. We will use the measured UV properties of local galaxies, along with corollary observations, to calibrate the relationship of the UV and global star formation rate in local galaxies. We will apply this calibration to distant galaxies discovered in the deep imaging and spectroscopic surveys to map the history of star formation in the universe over the redshift range 0<z<2 and probe the physical drivers of star formation in galaxies. The GALEX mission includes a guest investigator program, supporting the wide variety of programs made possible by the first UV sky survey.},

	abstract = {We present direct radii measurements of the well-known transiting exoplanet host stars HD 189733 and HD 209458 using the CHARA Array interferometer. We find the limb-darkened angular diameters to be thetaLD = 0.3848 $\pm$ 0.0055 and 0.2254 $\pm$ 0.0072 mas for HD 189733 and HD 209458, respectively. HD 189733 and HD 209458 are currently the only two transiting exoplanet systems where detection of the respective planetary companion's orbital motion from high-resolution spectroscopy has revealed absolute masses for both star and planet. We use our new measurements together with the orbital information from radial velocity and photometric time series data, Hipparcos distances, and newly measured bolometric fluxes to determine the stellar effective temperatures (Teff = 4875 $\pm$ 43, 6092 $\pm$ 103 K), stellar linear radii (R* = 0.805 $\pm$ 0.016, 1.203 $\pm$ 0.061 R&sun;), mean stellar densities (rho* = 1.62 $\pm$ 0.11, 0.58 $\pm$ 0.14 rho&sun;), planetary radii (Rp = 1.216 $\pm$ 0.024, 1.451 $\pm$ 0.074 RJup), and mean planetary densities (rhop = 0.605 $\pm$ 0.029, 0.196 $\pm$ 0.033 rhoJup) for HD 189733b and HD 209458b, respectively. The stellar parameters for HD 209458, an F9 dwarf, are consistent with indirect estimates derived from spectroscopic and evolutionary modelling. However, we find that models are unable to reproduce the observational results for the K2 dwarf, HD 189733. We show that, for stellar evolutionary models to match the observed stellar properties of HD 189733, adjustments lowering the solar-calibrated mixing-length parameter to alphaMLT =1.34 need to be employed.},

@article{Jordi2010,
	abstract = {Aims: The scientific community needs to be prepared to analyse the data from Gaia, one of the most ambitious ESA space missions, which is to be launched in 2012. The purpose of this paper is to provide data and tools to predict how Gaia photometry is expected to be. To do so, we provide relationships among colours involving Gaia magnitudes (white light G, blue GBP, red GRP and GRVS bands) and colours from other commonly used photometric systems (Johnson-Cousins, Sloan Digital Sky Survey, Hipparcos and Tycho).  Methods: The most up-to-date information from industrial partners has been used to define the nominal passbands, and based on the BaSeL3.1 stellar spectral energy distribution library, relationships were obtained for stars with different reddening values, ranges of temperatures, surface gravities and metallicities.  Results: The transformations involving Gaia and Johnson-Cousins V - IC and Sloan DSS g - z colours have the lowest residuals. A polynomial expression for the relation between the effective temperature and the colour GBP - GRP was derived for stars with Teff >= 4500 K. For stars with Teff < 4500 K, dispersions exist in gravity and metallicity for each absorption value in g - r and r - i. Transformations involving two Johnson or two Sloan DSS colours yield lower residuals than using only one colour. We also computed several ratios of total-to-selective absorption including absorption AG in the G band and colour excess E(GBP - GRP) for our sample stars. A relationship involving AG/AV and the intrinsic (V - IC) colour is provided. The derived Gaia passbands have been used to compute tracks and isochrones using the Padova and BASTI models. Finally, the performances of the predicted Gaia magnitudes have been estimated according to the magnitude and the celestial coordinates of the star.  Conclusions: The provided dependencies among colours can be used for planning scientific exploitation of Gaia data, performing simulations of the Gaia-like sky, planning ground-based complementary observations and for building catalogues with auxiliary data for the Gaia data processing and validation.

	abstract = {Stars on the main sequence are expected to be completely convective if their mass lies below a certain value, Mcc. Standard stellar structure codes suggest that Mcc is in the range 0.3-0.4 Msolar. In the present paper we examine several nonstandard additions to stellar structure in order to quantify their effects on the value of Mcc. We find that by including magnetic field effects, Mcc may fall to values that are significantly smaller than the standard range. This result is of interest in understanding why coronae and chromospheres in active M dwarfs fail to exhibit detectable alterations at spectral class M3-M4. The structural properties of our magnetic models also explain why active M dwarfs tend to have radii that are larger than expected for their Teff values or Teff values that are too low for their radii. Our results lead us to predict that certain stars that are classified as late L or T stars may actually have masses of 0.1-0.15 Msolar.},

	abstract = {Context: We examine the evolution of low-mass star and brown dwarf eclipsing binaries. These objects are rapid rotators and are believed to shelter large magnetic fields.  Aims: We suggest that reduced convective efficiency, due to fast rotation and large field strengths, and/or to magnetic spot coverage of the radiating surface significantly affect their evolution, leading to a reduced heat flux and thus larger radii and cooler effective temperatures than for regular objects.  Methods: We have considered such processes in our evolutionary calculations, using a phenomenological approach.  Results: This yields mass-radius and effective temperature-radius relationships in agreement with the observations. We also reproduce the effective temperature ratio and the radii of the two components of the recently discovered puzzling eclipsing brown dwarf system.  Conclusions: These calculations show that fast rotation and/or magnetic activity may significantly affect the evolution of eclipsing binaries and that the mechanical and thermal properties of these objects depart from the ones of non-active low-mass objects. We find that, for internal field strengths compatible with the observed surface value of a few kiloGauss, convection can be severely inhibited. The onset of a central radiative zone for rapidly rotating active low-mass stars might thus occur below the usual ~0.35 M_&sun; limit.},

@article{MacDonald2012,
	abstract = {The eclipsing binary CM Draconis (CM Dra) contains two nearly identical red dwarfs of spectral class dM4.5. The masses and radii of the two components have been reported with unprecedentedly small statistical errors: for M, these errors are 1 part in 260, while for R, the errors reported by Morales et al. are 1 part in 130. When compared with standard stellar models with appropriate mass and age (≈4 Gyr), the empirical results indicate that both components are discrepant from the models in the following sense: the observed stars are larger in R ('bloated'), by several standard deviations, than the models predict. The observed luminosities are also lower than the models predict. Here, we attempt at first to model the two components of CM Dra in the context of standard (non-magnetic) stellar models using a systematic array of different assumptions about helium abundances (Y), heavy element abundances (Z), opacities and mixing length parameter (alpha). We find no 4-Gyr-old models with plausible values of these four parameters that fit the observed L and R within the reported statistical error bars.  However, CM Dra is known to contain magnetic fields, as evidenced by the occurrence of star-spots and flares. Here we ask: can inclusion of magnetic effects into stellar evolution models lead to fits of L and R within the error bars? Morales et al. have reported that the presence of polar spots results in a systematic overestimate of R by a few per cent when eclipses are interpreted with a standard code. In a star where spots cover a fraction f of the surface area, we find that the revised R and L for CM Dra A can be fitted within the error bars by varying the parameter alpha. The latter is often assumed to be reduced by the presence of magnetic fields, although the reduction in alpha as a function of B is difficult to quantify. An alternative magnetic effect, namely inhibition of the onset of convection, can be readily quantified in terms of a magnetic parameter delta≈B2/4pigammapgas (where B is the strength of the local vertical magnetic field). In the context of delta models in which B is not allowed to exceed a 'ceiling' of 106 G, we find that the revised R and L can also be fitted, within the error bars, in a finite region of the f-delta plane. The permitted values of delta near the surface leads us to estimate that the vertical field strength on the surface of CM Dra A is about 500 G, in good agreement with independent observational evidence for similar low-mass stars. Recent results for another binary with parameters close to those of CM Dra suggest that metallicity differences cannot be the dominant explanation for the bloating of the two components of CM Dra.},

	abstract = {We report extensive photometric and spectroscopic observations of the 6.1 day period, G+M-type detached double-lined eclipsing binary V530 Ori, an important new benchmark system for testing stellar evolution models for low-mass stars. We determine accurate masses and radii for the components with errors of 0.7% and 1.3%, as follows: M A = 1.0038 $\pm$ 0.0066 M ☉, M B = 0.5955 $\pm$ 0.0022 M ☉, R A = 0.980 $\pm$ 0.013 R ☉, and R B = 0.5873 $\pm$ 0.0067 R ☉. The effective temperatures are 5890 $\pm$ 100 K (G1 V) and 3880 $\pm$ 120 K (M1 V), respectively. A detailed chemical analysis probing more than 20 elements in the primary spectrum shows the system to have a slightly subsolar abundance, with [Fe/H] = --0.12 $\pm$ 0.08. A comparison with theory reveals that standard models underpredict the radius and overpredict the temperature of the secondary, as has been found previously for other M dwarfs. On the other hand, models from the Dartmouth series incorporating magnetic fields are able to match the observations of the secondary star at the same age as the primary (~3 Gyr) with a surface field strength of 2.1 $\pm$ 0.4 kG when using a rotational dynamo prescription, or 1.3 $\pm$ 0.4 kG with a turbulent dynamo approach, not far from our empirical estimate for this star of 0.83 $\pm$ 0.65 kG. The observations are most consistent with magnetic fields playing only a small role in changing the global properties of the primary. The V530 Ori system thus provides an important demonstration that recent advances in modeling appear to be on the right track to explain the long-standing problem of radius inflation and temperature suppression in low-mass stars.},

@article{Bonaca2012,
	abstract = {Stellar models generally use simple parameterizations to treat convection. The most widely used parameterization is the so-called mixing-length theory where the convective eddy sizes are described using a single number, alpha, the mixing-length parameter. This is a free parameter, and the general practice is to calibrate alpha using the known properties of the Sun and apply that to all stars. Using data from NASA's Kepler mission we show that using the solar-calibrated alpha is not always appropriate, and that in many cases it would lead to estimates of initial helium abundances that are lower than the primordial helium abundance. Kepler data allow us to calibrate alpha for many other stars and we show that for the sample of stars we have studied, the mixing-length parameter is generally lower than the solar value. We studied the correlation between alpha and stellar properties, and we find that alpha increases with metallicity. We therefore conclude that results obtained by fitting stellar models or by using population-synthesis models constructed with solar values of alpha are likely to have large systematic errors. Our results also confirm theoretical expectations that the mixing-length parameter should vary with stellar properties.},

@article{Iglesias1996,
	abstract = {The reexamination of astrophysical opacities has eliminated gross discrepancies between a variety of observations and theoretical calculations; thus allowing for more detailed tests of stellar models. A number of such studies indicate that model results are sensitive to modest changes in the opacity. Consequently, it is desirable to update available opacity databases with recent improvements in physics, refinements of element abundance, and other such factors affecting the results.  Updated OPAL Rosseland mean opacities are presented. The new results have incorporated improvements in the physics and numerical procedures as well as corrections. The main opacity changes are increases of as much as 20% for Population I stars due to the explicit inclusion of 19 metals (compared to 12 metals in the earlier calculations) with the other modifications introducing opacity changes smaller than 10%. In addition, the temperature and density range covered by the updated opacity tables has been extended. As before, the tables allow accurate interpolation in density and temperature as well as hydrogen, helium, carbon, oxygen, and metal mass fractions. Although a specific metal composition is emphasized, opacity tables for different metal distributions can be made readily available. The updated opacities are compared to other work.},

	abstract = {The discrepancy between the observed and the theoretically predicted luminosity-mass relation in low-mass stars of less than or equal to 0.3 solar mass is examined. The lower observed result is explained by using the latest molecular opacities and by the consequent need to assume a ratio of mixing length to scale height (l/Hp) at T less than 9000 K in the range 0.07 to 0.17, rather than the more conventional values of 1.0 to 2.0. This assumption of a low surface layer l/Hp ratio yields significantly higher central temperatures (and hence luminosities) and quite large radiative cores, regardless of the deeper l/Hp value and equation-of-state uncertainties. The low l/Hp ratio is explained by the interaction of magnetic field with convection. Several consequences of this result, including the interstellar abundance of He-3(+), are discussed.},

@article{Ferguson2005,
	abstract = {Previous computations of low-temperature Rosseland and Planck mean opacities from Alexander & Ferguson are updated and expanded. The new computations include a more complete equation of state (EOS) with more grain species and updated optical constants. Grains are now explicitly included in thermal equilibrium in the EOS calculation, which allows for a much wider range of grain compositions to be accurately included than was previously the case. The inclusion of high-temperature condensates such as Al2O3 and CaTiO3 significantly affects the total opacity over a narrow range of temperatures before the appearance of the first silicate grains. The new opacity tables are tabulated for temperatures ranging from 30,000 to 500 K with gas densities from 10-4 to 10-19 g cm-3. Comparisons with previous Rosseland mean opacity calculations are discussed. At high temperatures, the agreement with OPAL and Opacity Project is quite good. Comparisons at lower temperatures are more divergent as a result of differences in molecular and grain physics included in different calculations. The computation of Planck mean opacities performed with the opacity sampling method is shown to require a very large number of opacity sampling wavelength points; previously published results obtained with fewer wavelength points are shown to be significantly in error. Methods for requesting or obtaining the new tables are provided.},

	abstract = {We examine the hypothesis that magnetic fields are inflating the radii of fully convective main-sequence stars in detached eclipsing binaries (DEBs). The magnetic Dartmouth stellar evolution code is used to analyze two systems in particular: Kepler-16 and CM Draconis. Magneto-convection is treated assuming stabilization of convection and also by assuming reductions in convective efficiency due to a turbulent dynamo. We find that magnetic stellar models are unable to reproduce the properties of inflated fully convective main-sequence stars, unless strong interior magnetic fields in excess of 10 MG are present. Validation of the magnetic field hypothesis given the current generation of magnetic stellar evolution models therefore depends critically on whether the generation and maintenance of strong interior magnetic fields is physically possible. An examination of this requirement is provided. Additionally, an analysis of previous studies invoking the influence of star spots is presented to assess the suggestion that star spots are inflating stars and biasing light curve analyses toward larger radii. From our analysis, we find that there is not yet sufficient evidence to definitively support the hypothesis that magnetic fields are responsible for the observed inflation among fully convective main-sequence stars in DEBs.},

These new X-ray observations resulted in a detection rate of almost 94% for all K and M stars within 6 pc around the Sun, and 87% for K and M dwarfs within 7 pc around the Sun. The resulting X-ray luminosity distribution function can be well described by a log-normal distribution; the largest and smallest X-ray luminosities from our sample stars differ by almost four orders of magnitude. We show the existence of a correlation between total emitted X-ray luminosity and spectral hardness, such that more luminous objects tend to have larger spectral hardness, thus implying higher coronal temperatures. A comparison with Einstein data shows the lack of significant variability in excess of a factor of 2 in our sample stars.},

	abstract = {We present the ROSAT All-Sky Survey Bright Source Catalogue (RASS-BSC, revision 1RXS) derived from the all-sky survey performed during the first half year (1990/91) of the ROSAT mission. 18,811 sources are catalogued (i) down to a limiting ROSAT PSPC count-rate of 0.05 cts s(-1) in the 0.1-2.4 keV energy band, (ii) with a detection likelihood of at least 15 and (iii) at least 15 source counts. The 18,811 sources underwent both an automatic validation and an interactive visual verification process in which for 94% of the sources the results of the standard processing were confirmed. The remaining 6% have been analyzed using interactive methods and these sources have been flagged. Flags are given for (i) nearby sources; (ii) sources with positional errors; (iii) extended sources; (iv) sources showing complex emission structures; and (v) sources which are missed by the standard analysis software. Broad band (0.1-2.4 keV) images are available for sources flagged by (ii), (iii) and (iv). For each source the ROSAT name, position in equatorial coordinates, positional error, source count-rate and error, background count-rate, exposure time, two hardness-ratios and errors, extent and likelihood of extent, likelihood of detection, and the source extraction radius are provided. At a brightness limit of 0.1 cts s(-1) (8,547 sources) the catalogue represents a sky coverage of 92%. The RASS-BSC, the table of possible identification candidates, and the broad band images are available in electronic form (Voges et al. 1996a) via http://wave.xray.mpe.mpg.de/rosat/catalogues/rass-bsc. The RASS-BSC and the identification table are also available in electronic form at the CDS via anonymous ftp to cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr (130.79.128.5) or via http://cdsweb.u-strasbg.fr/Abstract.html},

	abstract = {Free of any atmospheric contamination, the {Hubble Space Telescope} provides the best available spectrophotometry from the far-UV to the near-IR for stars as faint as V˜16. The HST CALSPEC standard star network is based on three standard candles: the hot, pure hydrogen white dwarf (WD) stars  G 191B2B, GD 153, and GD 71, which have Hubeny NLTE flux calculations that require the atomic physics for only one atom. These model flux distributions are normalized to the absolute flux for Vega of 3.46×10-9 erg cm-2 s-1 {\AA}-1 at 5556 {\AA} using precise Landolt V band photometry and the V bandpass function corrected for atmospheric transmission by M. Cohen. The three primary WD standards provide absolute flux calibrations for FOS, STIS  and  NICMOS spectrophotometry from these instruments on the HST. About 32 stellar spectral energy distributions (SEDs) have been constructed with a primary pedigree from the STIS data, which extends from 1150 {\AA} for the hot stars to a long wavelength limit of 1 mum.  NICMOS grism spectrophotometry provides an extension to 1.9 mum in the IR for 17 of the HST standards and longward to 2.5 mum for a few of the brighter stars. Included among these HST standards are Vega, the Sloan standard BD+17 4708, three bright solar analog candidates, three cool stars of type M or later, and five hot WDs. In addition, four K giants and four main sequence A-stars have  NICMOS spectrophotometry from 0.8-2.5 mum. The WD fluxes are compared to their modeled SEDs and demonstrate an internal precision of 1-2%, while the A-stars agree with the Cohen IR fluxes to ˜2%. Three solar analog candidate stars differ from the solar spectrum by up to 10% in the region of heavy line blanketing from 3000-4000 {\AA} and show differences in shape of ˜5% in the IR around 1.8 mum.},

	abstract = {We have conducted a kinematic study of 165 young M dwarfs with ages of lsim300 Myr. Our sample is composed of stars and brown dwarfs with spectral types ranging from K7 to L0, detected by ROSAT and with photometric distances of lsim25 pc assuming that the stars are single and on the main sequence. In order to find stars kinematically linked to known young moving groups (YMGs), we measured radial velocities for the complete sample with Keck and CFHT optical spectroscopy and trigonometric parallaxes for 75 of the M dwarfs with the CAPSCam instrument on the du Pont 2.5 m Telescope. Due to their youthful overluminosity and unresolved binarity, the original photometric distances for our sample underestimated the distances by 70% on average, excluding two extremely young (lsim3 Myr) objects found to have distances beyond a few hundred parsecs. We searched for kinematic matches to 14 reported YMGs and identified 10 new members of the AB Dor YMG and 2 of the Ursa Majoris group. Additional possible candidates include six Castor, four Ursa Majoris, two AB Dor members, and one member each of the Her-Lyr and beta Pic groups. Our sample also contains 27 young low-mass stars and 4 brown dwarfs with ages lsim150 Myr that are not associated with any known YMG. We identified an additional 15 stars that are kinematic matches to one of the YMGs, but the ages from spectroscopic diagnostics and/or the positions on the sky do not match. These warn against grouping stars together based only on kinematics and that a confluence of evidence is required to claim that a group of stars originated from the same star-forming event.  Based on observations collected at the W. M. Keck Observatory, the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope, the du Pont Telescope at Las Campanas Observatory, and the Subaru Telescope. The Keck Observatory is operated as a scientific partnership between the California Institute of Technology, the University of California, and NASA, and was made possible by the generous financial support of the W. M. Keck Foundation. The CFHT is operated by the National Research Council of Canada, the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique of France, and the University of Hawaii.},

The trigonometric parallaxes and proper motions presented are the last that were obtained with the CTIO 1.5 m telescope, which targeted the fainter subset of the CTIOPI input list. First trigonometric parallaxes are given for 22 systems, of which one is within 10 pc (DENIS 0255-4700), and 10 of which are between 10 and 25 pc. At a distance of 4.97+/-0.10 pc, and with a spectral type of L7.5 V, DENIS 0255-4700 is now the closest known L dwarf. In addition, with MV=24.44, it is the faintest dwarf with a measured absolute visual magnitude. We present preliminary trigonometric parallaxes for five additional systems worthy of follow-up, and VRIJHKS photometry and photometric distance estimates for four of them. We also give photometry and distance estimates for 21 other promising targets in our input list for which definitive trigonometric parallaxes were not possible; 13 are likely to be closer than 25 pc. We also present color-magnitude and color-color diagrams, which, in combination with theoretical isochrones from the literature, tangential velocities, and MR and MJ, have aided to identify the general nature of each of our targets. We have in this way discovered one new (spectroscopically confirmed) subdwarf and two suspected extreme subdwarfs that could be among the most extreme cases of these objects. We have also identified several very low mass stars, a few of which could be brown dwarfs. This concludes the CTIOPI 1.5 m program, from which we have derived a total of 69 trigonometric parallaxes (55 definitive, 6 preliminary, and 8 calibration).},

	abstract = {We present results from the PARallaxes of Southern Extremely Cool objects (PARSEC) program, an observational program begun in 2007 April to determine parallaxes for 122 L and 28 T southern hemisphere dwarfs using the Wide Field Imager on the ESO 2.2 m telescope. The results presented here include parallaxes of 10 targets from observations over 18 months and a first version proper motion catalog. The proper motions were obtained by combining PARSEC observations astrometrically reduced with respect to the Second US Naval Observatory CCD Astrograph Catalog, and the Two Micron All Sky Survey Point Source Catalog. The resulting median proper motion precision is 5 mas yr-1 for 195,700 sources. The 140 0.3 deg2 fields sample the southern hemisphere in an unbiased fashion with the exception of the galactic plane due to the small number of targets in that region. The proper motion distributions are shown to be statistically well behaved. External comparisons are also fully consistent. We will continue to update this catalog until the end of the program, and we plan to improve it including also observations from the GSC2.3 database. We present preliminary parallaxes with a 4.2 mas median precision for 10 brown dwarfs, two of which are within 10 pc. These increase the present number of L dwarfs by 20% with published parallaxes. Of the 10 targets, seven have been previously discussed in the literature: two were thought to be binary, but the PARSEC observations show them to be single; one has been confirmed as a binary companion and another has been found to be part of a binary system, both of which will make good benchmark systems. These results confirm that the foreseen precision of PARSEC can be achieved and that the large field of view will allow us to identify wide binary systems. Observations for the PARSEC program will end in early 2011 providing three to four years of coverage for all targets. The main expected outputs are: more than a 100% increase in the number of L dwarfs with parallaxes, increment in the number of objects per spectral subclass up to L9---in conjunction with published results---to at least 10, and to put sensible limits on the general binary fraction of brown dwarfs. We aim to contribute significantly to the understanding of the faint end of the H-R diagram and of the L/T transition region.},

These include astrometric data from the CTIO 0.9 m, from which we derive a proper motion of 342.0 $\pm$ 0.5 mas yr-1, a trigonometric parallax of 119.21 $\pm$ 0.98 mas (8.39 $\pm$ 0.07 pc), and photometry and photometric variability at optical wavelengths. We also provide spectroscopic data, including radial velocity (22.4 $\pm$ 0.3 km s-1), lithium equivalent width (EW) (0.28 $\pm$ 0.02 {\AA}), Halpha EW (-6.0 to -35 {\AA}), vsin i (11 $\pm$ 1 km s-1), and gravity indicators from the Siding Spring 2.3 m WiFeS, Lick 3 m Hamilton echelle, and Keck-I HIRES echelle spectrographs. The combined observations demonstrate that AP Col is the closer of only two known systems within 10 pc of the Sun younger than 100 Myr. Given its space motion and apparent age of 12-50 Myr, AP Col is likely a member of the recently proposed ~40 Myr old Argus/IC 2391 Association.},

The stars have 6.67<=slant {{V}J}<=slant 21.38 and 3.50<=slant ({{V}J}-{{K}s})<=slant 9.27, covering the entire M dwarf spectral sequence from M0.0 V through M9.5 V. This sample therefore provides a comprehensive snapshot of our current knowledge of the southern sky for the nearest M dwarfs that dominate the stellar population of the Galaxy. Roughly one-third of the 1748 systems, each of which has an M dwarf primary, have published high quality parallaxes, including 179 from the REsearch Consortium On Nearby Stars astrometry program. For the remaining systems, we offer photometric distance estimates that have well-calibrated errors. The bulk of these (~700) are based on new {{V}J}{{R}KC}{{I}KC} photometry acquired at the CTIO/SMARTS 0.9 m telescope, while the remaining 500 primaries have photographic plate distance estimates calculated using SuperCOSMOS {{B}J}{{R}59F}{{I}IVN} photometry.

@article{Bass2012,
	abstract = {KIC 6131659 is a long-period (17.5 days) eclipsing binary discovered by the Kepler mission. We analyzed six quarters of Kepler data along with supporting ground-based photometric and spectroscopic data to obtain accurate values for the mass and radius of both stars, namely, M 1 = 0.922 $\pm$ 0.007 M &sun;, R 1 = 0.8800 $\pm$ 0.0028 R &sun;, and M 2 = 0.685 $\pm$ 0.005 M &sun;, R 2 = 0.6395 $\pm$ 0.0061 R &sun;. There is a well-known issue with low-mass (M <~ 0.8 M &sun;) stars (in cases where the mass and radius measurement uncertainties are smaller than 2% or 3%) where the measured radii are almost always 5% to 15% larger than expected from evolutionary models, i.e., the measured radii are all above the model isochrones in a mass-radius plane. In contrast, the two stars in KIC 6131659 were found to sit on the same theoretical isochrone in the mass-radius plane. Until recently, all of the well-studied eclipsing binaries with low-mass stars had periods of less than about three days. The stars in such systems may have been inflated by high levels of stellar activity induced by tidal effects in these close binaries. KIC 6131659 shows essentially no evidence of enhanced stellar activity, and our measurements support the hypothesis that the unusual mass-radius relationship observed in most low-mass stars is influenced by strong magnetic activity created by the rapid rotation of the stars in tidally locked, short-period systems. Finally, using short cadence data, we show that KIC 6131657 has one of the smallest measured non-zero eccentricities of a binary with two main-sequence stars, where ecos omega = (4.57 $\pm$ 0.02) × 10-5.

	abstract = {We show that the star known as 2MASS J05162881+2607387 (hereafter J0516) is a double-lined eclipsing binary with nearly identical low-mass components. The spectroscopic elements derived from 18 spectra obtained with the High Resolution Spectrograph on the Hobby-Eberly Telescope during the fall of 2005 are K1=88.45+/-0.48 and K2=90.43+/-0.60 km s-1, resulting in a mass ratio of q=K1/K2=0.978+/-0.018 and minimum masses of M1sin3i=0.775+/-0.016 Msolar and M2sin3i=0.759+/-0.012 Msolar, respectively. We have extensive differential photometry of J0516 obtained over several nights between 2004 January and March (epoch 1) and between 2004 October and 2005 January plus 2006 January (epoch 2) using the 1 m telescope at the Mount Laguna Observatory. The source was roughly 0.1 mag brighter in all three bandpasses during epoch 1 when compared to epoch 2. Also, phased light curves from epoch 1 show considerable out-of-eclipse variability, presumably due to bright spots on one or both stars. In contrast, the phased light curves from epoch 2 show little out-of-eclipse variability. The light curves from epoch 2 and the radial velocity curves were analyzed using our ELC code with updated model atmospheres for low-mass stars. We find the following: M1=0.787+/-0.012 Msolar, R1=0.788+/-0.015 Rsolar, M2=0.770+/-0.009 Msolar, and R2=0.817+/-0.010 Rsolar. The stars in J0516 have radii that are significantly larger than model predictions for their masses, similar to what is seen in a handful of other well-studied low-mass double-lined eclipsing binaries. We compiled all recent mass and radius determinations from low-mass binaries and determine an empirical mass-radius relation of the form R(Rsolar)=0.0324+0.9343M(Msolar)+0.0374M2(Msolar).

	abstract = {We discuss the discovery and characterization of the circumbinary planet Kepler-38b. The stellar binary is single-lined, with a period of 18.8 days, and consists of a moderately evolved main-sequence star (MA = 0.949 $\pm$ 0.059 M &sun; and RA = 1.757 $\pm$ 0.034 R &sun;) paired with a low-mass star (MB = 0.249 $\pm$ 0.010 M &sun; and RB = 0.2724 $\pm$ 0.0053 R &sun;) in a mildly eccentric (e = 0.103) orbit. A total of eight transits due to a circumbinary planet crossing the primary star were identified in the Kepler light curve (using Kepler Quarters 1-11), from which a planetary period of 105.595 $\pm$ 0.053 days can be established. A photometric dynamical model fit to the radial velocity curve and Kepler light curve yields a planetary radius of 4.35 $\pm$ 0.11 R ⊕, or equivalently 1.12 $\pm$ 0.03 R Nep. Since the planet is not sufficiently massive to observably alter the orbit of the binary from Keplerian motion, we can only place an upper limit on the mass of the planet of 122 M ⊕ (7.11 M Nep or equivalently 0.384 M Jup) at 95% confidence. This upper limit should decrease as more Kepler data become available.

	abstract = {We report the detection of Kepler-47, a system consisting of two planets orbiting around an eclipsing pair of stars. The inner and outer planets have radii 3.0 and 4.6 times that of Earth, respectively. The binary star consists of a Sun-like star and a companion roughly one-third its size, orbiting each other every 7.45 days. With an orbital period of 49.5 days, 18 transits of the inner planet have been observed, allowing a detailed characterization of its orbit and those of the stars. The outer planet's orbital period is 303.2 days, and although the planet is not Earth-like, it resides within the classical ``habitable zone,'' where liquid water could exist on an Earth-like planet. With its two known planets, Kepler-47 establishes that close binary stars can host complete planetary systems.},

	abstract = {We report extensive spectroscopic and differential photometric BVRI observations of the active, detached, 1.309-day double-lined eclipsing binary IM Vir, composed of a G7-type primary and a K7 secondary. With these observations, we derive accurate absolute masses and radii of M 1 = 0.981 $\pm$ 0.012 M sun, M 2 = 0.6644 $\pm$ 0.0048 M sun, R 1 = 1.061 $\pm$ 0.016 R sun, and R 2 = 0.681 $\pm$ 0.013 R sun for the primary and secondary, with relative errors under 2%. The effective temperatures are 5570 $\pm$ 100 K and 4250 $\pm$ 130 K, respectively. The significant difference in mass makes this a favorable case for comparison with stellar evolution theory. We find that both stars are larger than the models predict, by 3.7% for the primary and 7.5% for the secondary, as well as cooler than expected, by 100 K and 150 K, respectively. These discrepancies are in line with previously reported differences in low-mass stars, and are believed to be caused by chromospheric activity, which is not accounted for in current models. The effect is not confined to low-mass stars: the rapidly rotating primary of IM Vir joins the growing list of objects of near-solar mass (but still with convective envelopes) that show similar anomalies. The comparison with the models suggests an age of 2.4 Gyr for the system, and a metallicity of [Fe/H] ≈-0.3 that is consistent with other indications, but requires confirmation.},

	abstract = {Full tests of stellar models below 1Msun have been hindered until now by the scarce number of precise measurements of the stars' most fundamental parameters: their masses and radii. With current observational techniques, the required precision to distinguish between different models (errors < 2-3 %) can only be achieved using detached eclipsing binaries where 1) both stars are similar in mass, i.e. q = M1/M2 ˜ 1.0, and 2) each star is a main sequence object below 1Msun.  Until 2003 only three such binaries had been found and analyzed in detail. Two new systems were published in 2005 (Creevey et al.; L{\'o}pez-Morales & Ribas), almost doubling the previous number of data points. Here we present preliminary results for 3 new low-mass detached eclipsing binaries. These are the first studied systems from our sample of 41 new binaries (Shaw & L{\'o}pez-Morales, this proceedings). We also provide an updated comparison between the Mass-Radius and the Mass-Teff relations predicted by the models and the observational data from detached eclipsing binaries.},

	abstract = {We present the orbital and physical parameters of a newly discovered low-mass detached eclipsing binary from the All-Sky Automated Survey (ASAS) data base: ASAS J011328-3821.1 A, which is a member of a visual binary system with the secondary component separated by about 1.4 arcsec. The radial velocities have been calculated from the high-resolution spectra obtained with the 1.9-m Radcliffe telescope/Grating Instrument for Radiation Analysis with a Fibre-Fed Echelle (GIRAFFE) spectrograph, the 3.9-m Anglo-Australian Telescope (AAT)/University College London Echelle Spectrograph (UCLES) and the 3.0-m Shane telescope/Hamilton Spectrograph (HamSpec) on the basis of the TODCOR technique and the positions of the Halpha emission lines. For the analysis, we have used V- and I-band photometry obtained with the 1.0-m Elizabeth telescope and the 0.41-m Panchromatic Robotic Optical Monitoring and Polarimetry Telescopes (PROMPT), supplemented with the publicly available ASAS light curve of the system.  We have found that ASAS J011328-3821.1 A is composed of two late-type dwarfs, which have masses of M1 = 0.612 $\pm$ 0.030 M&sun; and M2 = 0.445 $\pm$ 0.019 M&sun; and radii of R1 = 0.596 $\pm$ 0.020 R&sun; and R2 = 0.445 $\pm$ 0.024 R&sun;. Both show a substantial level of activity, which manifests in strong Halpha and Hbeta emission and the presence of cool spots. The influence of the third light on the eclipsing pair properties has also been evaluated and the photometric properties of component B have been derived. A comparison with several popular stellar evolution models shows that the system is on its main-sequence evolution stage and that it is probably more metal-rich than the Sun. We have also found several clues to suggest that component B itself is a binary composed of two nearly identical ˜0.5-M&sun; stars.},

	abstract = {Using light curves from the HATNet survey for transiting extrasolar planets we investigate the optical broadband photometric variability of a sample of 27, 560 field K and M dwarfs selected by color and proper motion (V - K >~ 3.0, mu > 30 mas yr-1, plus additional cuts in J - H versus H - KS and on the reduced proper motion). We search the light curves for periodic variations and for large-amplitude, long-duration flare events. A total of 2120 stars exhibit potential variability, including 95 stars with eclipses and 60 stars with flares. Based on a visual inspection of these light curves and an automated blending classification, we select 1568 stars, including 78 eclipsing binaries (EBs), as secure variable star detections that are not obvious blends. We estimate that a further ~26% of these stars may be blends with fainter variables, though most of these blends are likely to be among the hotter stars in our sample. We find that only 38 of the 1568 stars, including five of the EBs, have previously been identified as variables or are blended with previously identified variables. One of the newly identified EBs is 1RXS J154727.5+450803, a known P = 3.55 day, late M-dwarf SB2 system, for which we derive preliminary estimates for the component masses and radii of M 1 = M 2 = 0.258 $\pm$ 0.008 M sun and R 1 = R 2 = 0.289 $\pm$ 0.007 R sun. The radii of the component stars are larger than theoretical expectations if the system is older than ~200 Myr. The majority of the variables are heavily spotted BY Dra-type stars for which we determine rotation periods. Using this sample, we investigate the relations between period, color, age, and activity measures, including optical flaring, for K and M dwarfs, finding that many of the well-established relations for F, G, and K dwarfs continue into the M dwarf regime. We find that the fraction of stars that is variable with peak-to-peak amplitudes greater than 0.01 mag increases exponentially with the V - KS color such that approximately half of field dwarfs in the solar neighborhood with M <~ 0.2 M sun are variable at this level. Our data hint at a change in the rotation-activity-age connection for stars with M <~ 0.25 M sun.},

@article{Torres2002,
	abstract = {We present new spectroscopic observations of the detached late-type double-lined eclipsing binary YY Geminorum (P=0.814 day), a member of the Castor sextuple system and one of the benchmarks for the comparison between observations and stellar evolution theory in the lower main sequence. In addition, we have reanalyzed existing light curves in several passbands using modern techniques that account for the conspicuous presence of spots. This, combined with the spectroscopy, has yielded a very precise determination of the absolute dimensions of the components, which are virtually identical to each other. We obtain for the mean mass, radius, and effective temperature the values M=0.5992+/-0.0047 Msolar, R=0.6191+/-0.0057 Rsolar, and Teff=3820+/-100 K, respectively. Both the mass and the radius determinations are good to better than 1%, which in the case of the radius represents a fourfold improvement over previous results and significantly enhances the value of this quantity for testing the models. We discuss the importance of systematic effects in these measurements by comparison with another high-precision determination of the mass by S{\'e}gransan and coworkers. A reanalysis of the Hipparcos transit data for Castor AB that accounts for the relative motion of the pair in its 467 yr period orbit has yielded an improved parallax for the system of 66.90+/-0.63 mas. With this, we have estimated the age (~370 Myr) and metal abundance ([Fe/H]~0.0) of YY Gem from isochrone fits to Castor A and B under the assumption of a common origin. This, along with the other physical properties, allow for an unusually stringent test of the models for low-mass stars. We have compared the observations of YY Gem with a large number of recent theoretical calculations, and we show that all models underestimate the radius by up to 20% and that most overestimate the effective temperature by 150 K or more. Both of these trends are confirmed by observations of another similar system in the Hyades (V818 Tau). Consequently, theoretical ages for relatively low mass objects such as T Tauri stars derived by placing them on the H-R diagram may be considerably biased. If the radius is used directly as a measure of evolution, ages could be underestimated by as much as a factor of 10 in this mass regime. In view of these discrepancies, absolute ages from essentially all current models for the lower main sequence must be viewed with at least some measure of skepticism. Finally, we derive a new and very accurate ephemeris based on all available times of eclipse, and we lay to rest previous claims of sudden changes in the orbital period of the binary, which we show to be spurious. Some of the observations reported here were obtained with the Multiple Mirror Telescope, a joint facility of the Smithsonian Institution and the University of Arizona.},

	abstract = {This is the second paper in a program to determine fundamental properties of main-sequence stars of types late F to K. Improved spectroscopic orbits are derived for the short-period detached eclipsing binaries UV Leo (G0+G2), UV Psc (G5+K3), and BH Vir (F8+G5). The spectra are obtained with the high-resolution Hamilton spectrometer on the 3 m Shane reflector of the Lick Observatory. A considerable body of photometry is available for each of the three systems, so that photometric parameters are known, allowing the properties of the stars to be evaluated with some confidence, despite intrinsic variations, presumably from star spots. The K3 secondary of UV Psc has a mass of 0.76 Msun, the smallest published in this series, although the secondaries of HP Aur and HS Aqr, binaries without adequate photometry, have masses 0.75 and 0.69 Msun, respectively, approaching that of the M dwarf, YY Gem, M=0.59 Msun. Most of the extant models of structure and evolution in the solar mass range do not extend to masses appreciably below 1 Msun because of the change of physical conditions at lower temperatures. Attempts to fit these models to binaries in which the two components differ appreciably in mass lead to contradictory values of the ages of the two components in each case, the secondaries appearing to be twice as old as the primaries or older. Available series of lower main-sequence models stop short of the 0.8 to 1 Msun region, so that their results are not available for comparison. It appears that the transition between the higher- and lower-mass regimes may be a difficult one because of the change of temperature regimes.},

	abstract = {We report the detection of eclipses in GJ 3236, a bright (I = 11.6), very low mass binary system with an orbital period of 0.77 days. Analysis of light and radial velocity curves of the system yielded component masses of 0.38 $\pm$ 0.02 M sun and 0.28 $\pm$ 0.02 M sun. The central values for the stellar radii are larger than the theoretical models predict for these masses, in agreement with the results for existing eclipsing binaries, although the present 5% observational uncertainties limit the significance of the larger radii to approximately 1sigma. Degeneracies in the light curve models resulting from the unknown configuration of surface spots on the components of GJ 3236 currently dominate the uncertainties in the radii, and could be reduced by obtaining precise, multiband photometry covering the full orbital period. The system appears to be tidally synchronized and shows signs of high activity levels as expected for such a short orbital period, evidenced by strong Halpha emission lines in the spectra of both components. These observations probe an important region of mass-radius parameter space around the predicted transition to fully convective stellar interiors, where there are a limited number of precise measurements available in the literature.},

@article{Morales2009a,
	abstract = {Spectroscopic and eclipsing binary systems offer the best means for determining accurate physical properties of stars, including their masses and radii. The data available for low-mass stars have yielded firm evidence that stellar structure models predict smaller radii and higher effective temperatures than observed, but the number of systems with detailed analyses is still small. In this paper, we present a complete reanalysis of one of such eclipsing systems, CM Dra, composed of two dM4.5 stars. New and existing light curves as well as a radial velocity curve are modeled to measure the physical properties of both components. The masses and radii determined for the components of CM Dra are M 1 = 0.2310 $\pm$ 0.0009 M sun, M 2 = 0.2141 $\pm$ 0.0010M sun, R 1 = 0.2534 $\pm$ 0.0019 R sun, and R 2 = 0.2396 $\pm$ 0.0015 R sun. With relative uncertainties well below the 1% level, these values constitute the most accurate properties to date for fully convective stars. This makes CM Dra a valuable benchmark for testing theoretical models. In comparing our measurements with theory, we confirm the discrepancies previously reported for other low-mass eclipsing binaries. These discrepancies seem likely to be due to the effects of magnetic activity. We find that the orbit of this system is slightly eccentric, and we have made use of eclipse timings spanning three decades to infer the apsidal motion and other related properties.},

Our uncertainties range from ~20 K to ~150 K in temperature, ~0.01 to ~0.06 in log (L/L &sun;) and ~3% to ~10% in radius. We check our methodology by comparing our calculated radii to radii directly measured via long baseline optical interferometry. We find evidence for the local minimum in the radius-temperature and radius-luminosity trends that signals the end of the stellar main sequence and the start of the brown dwarf sequence at T eff ~ 2075 K, log (L/L &sun;) ~ -3.9, and (R/R &sun;) ~ 0.086. The existence of this local minimum is predicted by evolutionary models, but at temperatures ~400 K cooler. The minimum radius happens near the locus of 2MASS J0523-1403, an L2.5 dwarf with V - K = 9.42. We make qualitative arguments as to why the effects of the recent revision in solar abundances accounts for the discrepancy between our findings and the evolutionary models. We also report new color-absolute magnitude relations for optical and infrared colors which are useful for estimating photometric distances. We study the optical variability of all 63 targets and find an overall variability fraction of 36^{+9}_{-7}% at a threshold of 15 mmag in the I band, which is in agreement with previous studies.},

@article{Muirhead2014,
	abstract = {We present H- and K-band spectra for late-type Kepler Objects of Interest (the "Cool KOIs"): low-mass stars with transiting-planet candidates discovered by NASA's Kepler Mission that are listed on the NASA Exoplanet Archive. We acquired spectra of 103 Cool KOIs and used the indices and calibrations of Rojas-Ayala et al. to determine their spectral types, stellar effective temperatures, and metallicities, significantly augmenting previously published values. We interpolate our measured effective temperatures and metallicities onto evolutionary isochrones to determine stellar masses, radii, luminosities, and distances, assuming the stars have settled onto the main sequence. As a choice of isochrones, we use a new suite of Dartmouth predictions that reliably include mid-to-late M dwarf stars. We identify five M4V stars: KOI-961 (confirmed as Kepler 42), KOI-2704, KOI-2842, KOI-4290, and the secondary component to visual binary KOI-1725, which we call KOI-1725 B. We also identify a peculiar star, KOI-3497, which has Na and Ca lines consistent with a dwarf star but CO lines consistent with a giant. Visible-wavelength adaptive optics imaging reveals two objects within a 1 arcsec diameter; however, the objects' colors are peculiar. The spectra and properties presented in this paper serve as a resource for prioritizing follow-up observations and planet validation efforts for the Cool KOIs and are all available for download online using the "data behind the figure" feature.},

@article{Jarrett2011,
	abstract = {We have carried out a survey of the north and south ecliptic poles, EP-N and EP-S, respectively, with the Spitzer Space Telescope and the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). The primary objective was to cross-calibrate WISE with the Spitzer and Midcourse Space Experiment (MSX) photometric systems by developing a set of calibration stars that are common to these infrared missions. The ecliptic poles were continuous viewing zones for WISE due to its polar-crossing orbit, making these areas ideal for both absolute and internal calibrations. The Spitzer IRAC and MIPS imaging survey covers a complete area of 0.40 deg2 for the EP-N and 1.28 deg2 for the EP-S. WISE observed the whole sky in four mid-infrared bands, 3.4, 4.6, 12, and 22 mum, during its eight-month cryogenic mission, including several hundred ecliptic polar passages; here we report on the highest coverage depths achieved by WISE, an area of ~1.5 deg2 for both poles. Located close to the center of the EP-N, the Sy-2 galaxy NGC 6552 conveniently functions as a standard calibrator to measure the red response of the 22 mum channel of WISE. Observations from Spitzer-IRAC/MIPS/IRS-LL and WISE show that the galaxy has a strong red color in the mid-infrared due to star-formation and the presence of an active galactic nucleus (AGN), while over a baseline >1 year the mid-IR photometry of NGC 6552 is shown to vary at a level less than 2%. Combining NGC 6552 with the standard calibrator stars, the achieved photometric accuracy of the WISE calibration, relative to the Spitzer and MSX systems, is 2.4%, 2.8%, 4.5%, and 5.7% for W1 (3.4 mum), W2 (4.6 mum), W3 (12 mum), and W4 (22 mum), respectively. The WISE photometry is internally stable to better than 0.1% over the cryogenic lifetime of the mission. The secondary objective of the Spitzer-WISE Survey was to explore the poles at greater flux-level depths, exploiting the higher angular resolution Spitzer observations and the exceptionally deep (in total coverage) WISE observations that potentially reach down to the confusion limit of the survey. The rich Spitzer and WISE data sets were used to study the Galactic and extragalactic populations through source counts, color-magnitude and color-color diagrams. As an example of what the data sets facilitate, we have separated stars from galaxies, delineated normal galaxies from power-law-dominated AGNs, and reported on the different fractions of extragalactic populations. In the EP-N, we find an AGN source density of ~260 deg-2 to a 12 mum depth of 115 muJy, representing 15% of the total extragalactic population to this depth, similar to what has been observed for low-luminosity AGNs in other fields.},

	abstract = {We present the results of an extensive high-resolution imaging survey of M-dwarf multiplicity using the Lucky Imaging technique. The survey made use of the AstraLux Norte camera at the Calar Alto 2.2 m telescope and the AstraLux Sur camera at the ESO New Technology Telescope in order to cover nearly the full sky. In total, 761 stars were observed (701 M-type and 60 late K-type), among which 182 new and 37 previously known companions were detected in 205 systems. Most of the targets have been observed during two or more epochs, and could be confirmed as physical companions through common proper motion, often with orbital motion being confirmed in addition. After accounting for various bias effects, we find a total M-dwarf multiplicity fraction of 27% $\pm$ 3% within the AstraLux detection range of 0farcs08-6'' (semimajor axes of ~3-227 AU at a median distance of 30 pc). We examine various statistical multiplicity properties within the sample, such as the trend of multiplicity fraction with stellar mass and the semimajor axis distribution. The results indicate that M-dwarfs are largely consistent with constituting an intermediate step in a continuous distribution from higher-mass stars down to brown dwarfs. Along with other observational results in the literature, this provides further indications that stars and brown dwarfs may share a common formation mechanism, rather than being distinct populations.  Based on observations collected at the European Southern Observatory, Chile, under observing programs 081.C-0314(A), 082.C-0053(A), and 084.C-0812(A), and on observations collected at the Centro Astron{\'o}mico Hispano Alem{\'a}n (CAHA) at Calar Alto, operated jointly by the Max-Planck Institute for Astronomy and the Instituto de Astrof{\'\i}sica de Andaluc{\'\i}a (CSIC).},

@article{Feiden2014,
	abstract = {We report an age revision for the low-mass detached eclipsing binary CM Draconis and its common proper motion companion, WD 1633+572. An age of 8.5 $\pm$ 3.5 Gyr is found by combining an age estimate for the lifetime of WD 1633+572 and an estimate from galactic space motions. The revised age is greater than a factor of two older than previous estimates. Our results provide consistency between the white dwarf age and the system's galactic kinematics, which reveal the system is a highly probable member of the galactic thick disk. We find the probability that CM Draconis and WD 1633+572 are members of the thick disk is 8500 times greater than the probability that they are members of the thin disk and 170 times greater than the probability they are halo interlopers. If CM Draconis is a member of the thick disk, it is likely enriched in alpha-elements compared to iron by at least 0.2 dex relative to the Sun. This leads to the possibility that previous studies under-estimate the [Fe/H] value, suggesting the system has a near-solar [Fe/H]. Implications for the long-standing discrepancies between the radii of CM Draconis and predictions from stellar evolution theory are discussed. We conclude that CM Draconis is only inflated by about 2% compared to stellar evolution predictions.},

@article{Vanderburg2014,
	abstract = {The original Kepler mission achieved high photometric precision thanks to ultrastable pointing enabled by use of four reaction wheels. The loss of two of these reaction wheels reduced the telescope's ability to point precisely for extended periods of time, and as a result, the photometric precision has suffered. We present a technique for generating photometric light curves from pixel-level data obtained with the two-wheeled extended Kepler mission, K2. Our photometric technique accounts for the nonuniform pixel response function of the Kepler detectors by correlating flux measurements with the spacecraft's pointing and removing the dependence. When we apply our technique to the ensemble of stars observed during the Kepler Two-Wheel Concept Engineering Test, we find improvements over raw K2 photometry by factors of 2-5, with noise properties qualitatively similar to Kepler targets at the same magnitudes. We find evidence that the improvement in photometric precision depends on each target's position in the Kepler field of view, with worst precision near the edges of the field. Overall, this technique restores the median-attainable photometric precision within a factor of two of the original Kepler photometric precision for targets ranging from 10th to 15th magnitude in the Kepler bandpass, peaking with a median precision within 35% to that of Kepler for stars between 12th and 13th magnitude in the Kepler bandpass.},

	abstract = {The stellar obliquity of a transiting planetary system can be constrained by combining measurements of the star's rotation period, radius, and projected rotational velocity. Here, we present a hierarchical Bayesian technique for recovering the obliquity distribution of a population of transiting planetary systems and apply it to a sample of 70 Kepler objects of interest. With ≈95% confidence, we find that the obliquities of stars with only a single detected transiting planet are systematically larger than those with multiple detected transiting planets. This suggests that a substantial fraction of Kepler's single-transiting systems represent dynamically hotter, less orderly systems than the "pancake-flat" multiple-transiting systems.},

The star is called SO 025300.5+165258 and referred to herein as a high proper motion star (HPMS). The discovery came as a result of a search of the SkyMorph database, a sensitive and persistent survey that is well suited for finding stars with high proper motions. There are currently only seven known stars with proper motions greater than 5" yr-1. The spectrum and measured tangential velocity indicate that the HPMS is a main-sequence star with spectral type M6.5. Trigonometric and photometric parallaxes have been determined, yielding distance estimates of 2.4+0.7-0.4 pc (lower limit) and 3.6+/-0.4 pc, respectively. If the former is correct, the HPMS ranks third in the list of nearest stellar systems. If the latter is correct, it is 17th. A more precise trigonometric parallax measurement is expected to be completed near the end of the year.},

Furthermore, when the true model is of finite dimension, AICC is found to provide better model order choices than any other asymptotically efficient method. Applications to nonstationary autoregressive and mixed autoregressive moving average time series models are also discussed.},

@article{Spada2013,
	abstract = {A long-standing issue in the theory of low-mass stars is the discrepancy between predicted and observed radii and effective temperatures. In spite of the increasing availability of very precise radius determinations from eclipsing binaries and interferometric measurements of radii of single stars, there is no unanimous consensus on the extent (or even the existence) of the discrepancy and on its connection with other stellar properties (e.g., metallicity, magnetic activity). We investigate the radius discrepancy phenomenon using the best data currently available (accuracy <~ 5%). We have constructed a grid of stellar models covering the entire range of low-mass stars (0.1-1.25 M &sun;) and various choices of the metallicity and mixing length parameter, alpha. We used an improved version of the Yale Rotational stellar Evolution Code, implementing surface boundary conditions based on the most up-to-date PHOENIX atmosphere models. Our models are in good agreement with others in the literature and improve and extend the low mass end of the Yale-Yonsei isochrones. Our calculations include rotation-related quantities, such as moments of inertia and convective turnover timescales, useful in studies of magnetic activity and rotational evolution of solar-like stars. Consistent with previous works, we find that both binaries and single stars have radii inflated by about 3% with respect to the theoretical models; among binaries, the components of short orbital period systems are found to be the most deviant. We conclude that both binaries and single stars are comparably affected by the radius discrepancy phenomenon.},

	abstract = {Secondary flux standards are established by measuring their brightness relative to primary standard stars. The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) primary standards are the three pure-hydrogen white dwarf (WD) flux standards that determine the sensitivity calibration for the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph. STIS observations have defined the flux of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) standard BD +17$\,^{\circ}$4708 from 0.17 to 1.0 mum with an uncertainty of less than 0.5% relative to the HST primary standards, as verified by two independent sets of photometry. The two CCD cameras, HRC and WFC, in the ACS instrument package on HST confirm the average ratio of BD +17$\,^{\circ}$4708 to the three fainter WD primary standards to better than 0.5% if a few of the ACS filter bandpasses have small wavelength shifts. With an uncertainty of less than 0.5% in the transfer of the flux calibration from the primary standards, the accuracy of the BD +17$\,^{\circ}$4708 relative flux distribution is essentially the same as that of the primary WDs, that is, ~2% in the relative fluxes over the 0.17-1 mum range. Our flux distribution agrees with the SDSS fluxes to within their quoted 3% uncertainty.},

	abstract = {Most known extrasolar planets (exoplanets) have been discovered using the radial velocity or transit methods. Both are biased towards planets that are relatively close to their parent stars, and studies find that around 17-30% (refs 4, 5) of solar-like stars host a planet. Gravitational microlensing, on the other hand, probes planets that are further away from their stars. Recently, a population of planets that are unbound or very far from their stars was discovered by microlensing. These planets are at least as numerous as the stars in the Milky Way. Here we report a statistical analysis of microlensing data (gathered in 2002-07) that reveals the fraction of bound planets 0.5-10 AU (Sun-Earth distance) from their stars. We find that  of stars host Jupiter-mass planets (0.3-10 MJ, where MJ = 318 M⊕ and M⊕ is Earth's mass). Cool Neptunes (10-30 M⊕) and super-Earths (5-10 M⊕) are even more common: their respective abundances per star are  and . We conclude that stars are orbited by planets as a rule, rather than the exception.},

@article{Casagrande2014,
	abstract = {After a pedagogical introduction to the main concepts of synthetic photometry, colours and bolometric corrections in the Johnson-Cousins, 2MASS, and HST-ACS/WFC3 photometric systems are generated from MARCS synthetic fluxes for various [Fe/H] and [alpha/Fe] combinations, and virtually any value of E(B - V) ≲ 0.7. The successes and failures of model fluxes in reproducing the observed magnitudes are highlighted. Overall, extant synthetic fluxes predict quite realistic broad-band colours and bolometric corrections, especially at optical and longer wavelengths: further improvements of the predictions for the blue and ultraviolet spectral regions await the use of hydrodynamic models where the microturbulent velocity is not treated as a free parameter. We show how the morphology of the colour-magnitude diagram (CMD) changes for different values of [Fe/H] and [alpha/Fe]; in particular, how suitable colour combinations can easily discriminate between red giant branch and lower main-sequence populations with different [alpha/Fe], due to the concomitant loops and swings in the CMD. We also provide computer programs to produce tables of synthetic bolometric corrections as well as routines to interpolate in them. These colour-Teff-metallicity relations may be used to convert isochrones for different chemical compositions to various bandpasses assuming observed reddening values, thus bypassing the standard assumption of a constant colour excess for stars of different spectral type. We also show how such an assumption can lead to significant systematic errors. The MARCS transformations presented in this study promise to provide important constraints on our understanding of the multiple stellar populations found in globular clusters (e.g. the colours of lower main-sequence stars are predicted to depend strongly on [alpha/Fe]) and of those located towards/in the Galactic bulge.},

@article{Howard2014,
	abstract = {We report the discovery of a low-mass planet orbiting Gl 15 A based on radial velocities from the Eta-Earth Survey using HIRES at Keck Observatory. Gl 15 Ab is a planet with minimum mass Msin i = 5.35 $\pm$ 0.75 M ⊕, orbital period P = 11.4433 $\pm$ 0.0016 days, and an orbit that is consistent with circular. We characterize the host star using a variety of techniques. Photometric observations at Fairborn Observatory show no evidence for rotational modulation of spots at the orbital period to a limit of ~0.1 mmag, thus supporting the existence of the planet. We detect a second RV signal with a period of 44 days that we attribute to rotational modulation of stellar surface features, as confirmed by optical photometry and the Ca II H & K activity indicator. Using infrared spectroscopy from Palomar-TripleSpec, we measure an M2 V spectral type and a sub-solar metallicity ([M/H] = -0.22, [Fe/H] = -0.32). We measure a stellar radius of 0.3863 $\pm$ 0.0021 R &sun; based on interferometry from CHARA.  Based on observations obtained at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated jointly by the University of California and the California Institute of Technology.

Overall, there are 15 red dwarf systems and 22 red subdwarf systems in the sample. Five of the systems are multiples with directly detected companions, and we have discovered perturbations caused by unseen companions in two additional cases, the dwarf LHS 501 and the subdwarf LHS 440. The latter system may eventually provide important dynamical mass points on the subdwarf mass-luminosity relation. Two additional stars of note are LHS 272, the third closest M-type subdwarf at a distance of only 13.6 pc, and LHS 2734 AB, a high-velocity subdwarf binary with V tan> 700 km s-1, which likely exceeds the escape velocity of the Milky Way. We also report the first long-term variability study of cool subdwarfs indicating that cool subdwarfs are less photometrically variable than their main-sequence counterparts.},

	abstract = {The measurement of precise absolute fluxes for stellar sources has been pursued with increased vigor since the discovery of dark energy and the realization that its detailed understanding requires accurate spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of redshifted Ia supernovae in the rest frame. The flux distributions of spectrophotometric standard stars were initially derived from the comparison of stars to laboratory sources of known flux but are now mostly based on calculated model atmospheres. For example, pure hydrogen white dwarf (WD) models provide the basis for the HST CALSPEC archive of flux standards. The basic equations for quantitative spectrophotometry and photometry are explained in detail. Several historical lab-based flux calibrations are reviewed; and the SEDs of stars in the major online astronomical databases are compared to the CALSPEC reference standard spectrophotometry. There is good evidence that relative fluxes from the visible to the near-IR wavelength of ˜2.5 mum are currently accurate to 1% for the primary reference standards, and new comparisons with lab flux standards show promise for improving that precision.},

	abstract = {The CHARA Array is a six telescope optical/IR interferometer run by the Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy of Georgia State University and is located at Mount Wilson Observatory just to the north of Los Angeles California. The CHARA Array has the largest operational baselines in the world and has been in regular use for scientific observations since 2004. In 2011 we received funding from the NSF to begin work on Adaptive Optics for our six telescopes. Phase I of this project, fully funded by the NSF grant, consists of designing and building wavefront sensors for each telescope that will also serve as tip/tilt detectors. Having tip/tilt at the telescopes, instead of in the laboratory, will add several magnitudes of sensitivity to this system. Phase I also includes a slow wavefront sensor in the laboratory to measure non-common path errors and small deformable mirrors in the laboratory to remove static and slowly changing aberrations. Phase II of the project will allow us to place high-speed deformable mirrors at the telescopes thereby enabling full closed loop operation. We are currently seeking funding for Phase II. This paper will describe the scientific rational and design of the system and give the current status of the project.},

	abstract = {The Precision Astronomical Visible Observations (PAVO) beam combiner is a new concept in visible beam combination, recently commissioned at the CHARA array. By creating spatially-modulated fringes in a pupil plane and then dispersing with an integral field unit, PAVO utilizes the full multi-r0 aperture of the CHARA array over a standard 50% (630-950nm) bandwidth. In addition, minimal optimized spatial filtering ensures calibration that is in principle as good as using single-mode fibers. We describe the design of and initial results from the PAVO instrument.},

	abstract = {The Praesepe open cluster represents a puzzle since it has about the same age as the Hyades, and only slightly different metallicity, yet previous ROSAT observations resulted in a detection rate of cluster sources significantly lower than for the Hyades. We present a new 50 ksec observation of Praesepe performed with the EPIC instrument on board XMM-Newton, which resulted in the detection of  ~ 200 sources, including 48 cluster members. We detected all solar-type (F-G) stars in the field of view,  ~ 90% of the K stars and  ~ 70% of the M stars. We find that the distribution of X-ray luminosities of solar-type Praesepe members is comparable to that of the Hyades, in contrast with the previous ROSAT results; however, the disagreement between the ROSAT and XMM-Newton results appears to be mostly due to X-ray faint Praesepe members falling outside the XMM-Newton field of view, while it is considerably reduced when considering only the subsample of stars in the ROSAT survey in common with the present observation. The finding supports an earlier suggestion that Praesepe may be formed by two merged clusters of different age.},

@article{Shkolnik2014,
	abstract = {The spectral energy distribution, variability, and evolution of the high-energy radiation from an M dwarf planet host is crucial in understanding the planet's atmospheric evolution and habitability and in interpreting the planet's spectrum. The star's extreme-UV (EUV), far-UV (FUV), and near-UV (NUV) emission can chemically modify, ionize, and erode the atmosphere over time. This makes determining the lifetime exposure of such planets to stellar UV radiation critical for both the evolution of a planet's atmosphere and our potential to characterize it. Using the early M star members of nearby young moving groups, which sample critical ages in planet formation and evolution, we measure the evolution of the GALEX NUV and FUV flux as a function of age. The median UV flux remains at a "saturated" level for a few hundred million years, analogous to that observed for X-ray emission. By the age of the Hyades Cluster (650 Myr), we measure a drop in UV flux by a factor of 2-3 followed by a steep drop from old (several Gyrs) field stars. This decline in activity beyond 300 Myr follows roughly t -1. Despite this clear evolution, there remains a wide range, of 1-2 orders of magnitude, in observed emission levels at every age. These UV data supply the much-needed constraints to M dwarf upper-atmosphere models, which will provide empirically motivated EUV predictions and more accurate age-dependent UV spectra as inputs to planetary photochemical models.  Based on observations made with the NASA Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX). GALEX was operated for NASA by the California Institute of Technology under NASA contract NAS5-98034.},

	abstract = {We calculate an empirical, non-parametric estimate of the shape of the period-marginalized radius distribution of planets with periods less than 150 days using the small yet well-characterized sample of cool (T eff < 4000 K) dwarf stars in the Kepler catalog. In particular, we present and validate a new procedure, based on weighted kernel density estimation, to reconstruct the shape of the planet radius function down to radii smaller than the completeness limit of the survey at the longest periods. Under the assumption that the period distribution of planets does not change dramatically with planet radius, we show that the occurrence of planets around these stars continues to increase to below 1 R ⊕, and that there is no strong evidence for a turnover in the planet radius function. In fact, we demonstrate using many iterations of simulated data that a spurious turnover may be inferred from data even when the true distribution continues to rise toward smaller radii. Finally, the sharp rise in the radius distribution below ~3 R ⊕ implies that a large number of planets await discovery around cool dwarfs as the sensitivities of ground-based transit surveys increase.},

	abstract = {We present the discovery of 57 wide (>5'') separation, low-mass (stellar and substellar) companions to stars in the solar neighborhood identified from Pan-STARRS 1 (PS1) data and the spectral classification of 31 previously known companions. Our companions represent a selective subsample of promising candidates and span a range in spectral type of K7-L9 with the addition of one DA white dwarf. These were identified primarily from a dedicated common proper motion search around nearby stars, along with a few as serendipitous discoveries from our Pan-STARRS 1 brown dwarf search. Our discoveries include 23 new L dwarf companions and one known L dwarf not previously identified as a companion. The primary stars around which we searched for companions come from a list of bright stars with well-measured parallaxes and large proper motions from the Hipparcos catalog (8583 stars, mostly A-K dwarfs) and fainter stars from other proper motion catalogs (79170 stars, mostly M dwarfs). We examine the likelihood that our companions are chance alignments between unrelated stars and conclude that this is unlikely for the majority of the objects that we have followed-up spectroscopically. We also examine the entire population of ultracool (>M7) dwarf companions and conclude that while some are loosely bound, most are unlikely to be disrupted over the course of ~10 Gyr. Our search increases the number of ultracool M dwarf companions wider than 300 AU by 88% and increases the number of L dwarf companions in the same separation range by 82%. Finally, we resolve our new L dwarf companion to HIP 6407 into a tight (0.''13, 7.4 AU) L1+T3 binary, making the system a hierarchical triple. Our search for these key benchmarks against which brown dwarf and exoplanet atmosphere models are tested has yielded the largest number of discoveries to date.},

@article{Mann2014,
	abstract = {Metallicity is a fundamental parameter that contributes to the physical characteristics of a star. The low temperatures and complex molecules present in M dwarf atmospheres make it difficult to measure their metallicities using techniques that have been commonly used for Sun-like stars. Although there has been significant progress in developing empirical methods to measure M dwarf metallicities over the last few years, these techniques have been developed primarily for early- to mid-M dwarfs. We present a method to measure the metallicity of mid- to late-M dwarfs from moderate resolution (R ~ 2000) K-band (sime 2.2 mum) spectra. We calibrate our formula using 44 wide binaries containing an F, G, K, or early-M primary of known metallicity and a mid- to late-M dwarf companion. We show that similar features and techniques used for early-M dwarfs are still effective for late-M dwarfs. Our revised calibration is accurate to ~0.07 dex for M4.5-M9.5 dwarfs with -0.58 < [Fe/H] < +0.56 and shows no systematic trends with spectral type, metallicity, or the method used to determine the primary star metallicity. We show that our method gives consistent metallicities for the components of M+M wide binaries. We verify that our new formula works for unresolved binaries by combining spectra of single stars. Lastly, we show that our calibration gives consistent metallicities with the Mann et al. study for overlapping (M4-M5) stars, establishing that the two calibrations can be used in combination to determine metallicities across the entire M dwarf sequence.},

A nonlinear least squares algorithm is used to solve for any subset of allowed parameters, which include atomic data (log gf and van der Waals damping constants), model atmosphere specifications (T_ eff_, logg), elemental abundances, and radial, turbulent, and rotational velocities. LTE synthesis software handles discontiguous spectral intervals and complex atomic blends. As a demonstration, we fit 26 FeI lines in the NSO Solar Atlas (Kurucz et al. 1984), determining various solar and atomic parameters.},

@article{Hamuy1994,
	abstract = {We have obtained new observations of both secondary and tertiary spectrophotometric standards with the RC spectrographs and CCD cameras on the 1.5-m and 4-m telescopes at Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO) in the wavelength range 6000-10,500 A. We use the secondary spectrophotometric standards in order to calculate new fluxes for the tertiary standards of Stone and Baldwin (1983), as well as for three stars of the Northern Hemisphere from Stone (1977). We find that the synthetic magnitudes calculated from our spectra through the IKC band agree extremely well with the observed photometry, to better than 1% on average. For the monochromatic fluxes, we find an internal precision better than 0.01 mag blueward of 9000 A, and increasingly larger for longer wavelengths. We present also a fine grid of averaged monochromatic fluxes (at continous steps of 16 A) for the ten secondary standards selected for our program, to be used in the flux calibration of high dispersion spectra. Finally, we provide combined fluxes for all secondary and tertiary standards in the range 3300-10,500 A resulting from the calibration presented here with the one published in Paper I (Hamuy et al. 1992).},

	abstract = {We present five new transit light curves of GJ 1214b taken in the BJHK s bands. Two transits were observed in the B band using the Subaru Prime Focus Camera (Suprime-Cam) and the Faint Object Camera and Spectrograph (FOCAS) instruments on board the Subaru 8.2 m telescope, and one transit was done in the JHK s bands simultaneously with the Simultaneous Infrared Imager for Unbiased Survey (SIRIUS) camera on the Infrared Survey Facility (IRSF) 1.4 m telescope. Markov Chain Monte Carlo analyses show that the planet-to-star radius ratios are R p/R s = 0.11651 $\pm$ 0.00065 (B band, Subaru/Suprime-Cam), R p/R s = 0.11601 $\pm$ 0.00117 (B band, Subaru/FOCAS), R p/R s = 0.11654 $\pm$ 0.00080 (J band, IRSF/SIRIUS), R_p/R_s = 0.11550 ^{+0.00142}_{-0.00153} (H band, IRSF/SIRIUS), and R p/R s = 0.11547 $\pm$ 0.00127 (K s band, IRSF/SIRIUS). The Subaru Suprime-Cam transit photometry shows a possible spot-crossing feature. Comparisons of the new transit depths and those from previous studies with the theoretical models by Howe & Burrows suggest that the high molecular weight atmosphere (e.g., 1% H2O + 99% N2) models are most likely, however, the low molecular weight (hydrogen-dominated) atmospheres with extensive clouds are still not excluded. We also report a long-term monitoring of the stellar brightness variability of GJ 1214 observed with the MITSuME 50 cm telescope in the g', R c, and I c bands simultaneously. The monitoring was conducted for 32 nights spanning 78 nights in 2012, and we find a periodic brightness variation with a period of P s = 44.3 $\pm$ 1.2 days and semi-amplitudes of 2.1% $\pm$ 0.4% in the g' band, 0.56% $\pm$ 0.08% in the R c band, and 0.32% $\pm$ 0.04% in the I c band.},

	abstract = {Binary systems with a substellar companion are quite rare and provide interesting benchmarks. They constrain the complex physics of substellar atmospheres, because several physical parameters of the substellar secondary can be fixed from the much better characterized main-sequence primary. We report the discovery of CFBDS J111807-064016, a T2 brown-dwarf companion to 2MASS J111806.99-064007.8, a low-mass M4.5-M5 star. The brown dwarf was identified from the Canada France Brown Dwarf Survey. At a distance of 50-120 pc, the 7.7'' angular separation corresponds to projected separations of 390-900 AU. The primary displays no Halpha emission, placing a lower limit on the age of the system of about 6 Gyr. The kinematics is also consistent with membership in the old thin disc. We obtained near-infrared spectra, which together with recent atmosphere models allow us to determine the effective temperature and gravity of the two components. We derived a system metallicity of [Fe/H] = -0.1 $\pm$ 0.1 using metallicity-sensitive absorption features in our medium-resolution Ks spectrum of the primary. From these parameters and the age constraint, evolutionary models estimate masses of 0.10 to 0.15 M&sun; for the M dwarf and 0.06 to 0.07 M&sun; for the T dwarf. This system is a particularly valuable benchmark because the brown dwarf belongs to the early-T class: the cloud-clearing that occurs at the L/T transition is very sensitive to gravity, metallicity, and detailed dust properties, and produces a large scatter in the colours. This T2 dwarf, with its metallicity measured from the primary and its mass and gravity much better constrained than those of younger early-Ts, will anchor our understanding of the colours of L/T transition brown dwarfs. It is also one of the most massive T dwarfs, just below the hydrogen-burning limit, and all this makes it a prime probe for brown-dwarf atmosphere and evolution models.

@article{Marocco:2013,
	abstract = {We present near-infrared spectroscopy for 52 ultracool dwarfs, including two newly discovered late-M dwarfs, one new late-M subdwarf candidate, three new L, and four new T dwarfs. We also present parallaxes and proper motions for 21 of them. Four of the targets presented here have previous parallax measurements, while all the others are new values. This allow us to populate further the spectral sequence at early types (L0-L4). Combining the astrometric parameters with the new near-infrared spectroscopy presented here, we are able to investigate further the nature of some of the objects. In particular, we find that the peculiar blue L1 dwarf SDSS J133148.92--011651.4 is a metal-poor object, likely a member of the galactic thick disk. We discover a new M subdwarf candidate, 2MASS J20115649--6201127. We confirm the low-gravity nature of EROS-MP J0032--4405, DENIS-P J035726.9--441730, and 2MASS J22134491--2136079. We present two new metal-poor dwarfs: the L4pec 2MASS J19285196--4356256 and the M7pec SIPS2346--5928. We also determine the effective temperature and bolometric luminosity of the 21 targets with astrometric measurements, and we obtain a new polynomial relation between effective temperature and near-infrared spectral type. The new fit suggests a flattening of the sequence at the transition between M and L spectral types. This could be an effect of dust formation, which causes a more rapid evolution of the spectral features as a function of the effective temperature.

	abstract = {We report the discovery of 76 new T dwarfs from the UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey (UKIDSS) Large Area Survey (LAS). Near-infrared broad- and narrow-band photometry and spectroscopy are presented for the new objects, along with Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) and warm-Spitzer photometry. Proper motions for 128 UKIDSS T dwarfs are presented from a new two epoch LAS proper motion catalogue. We use these motions to identify two new benchmark systems: LHS 6176AB, a T8p+M4 pair and HD 118865AB, a T5.5+F8 pair. Using age constraints from the primaries and evolutionary models to constrain the radii, we have estimated their physical properties from their bolometric luminosity. We compare the colours and properties of known benchmark T dwarfs to the latest model atmospheres and draw two principal conclusions. First, it appears that the H - [4.5] and J - W2 colours are more sensitive to metallicity than has previously been recognized, such that differences in metallicity may dominate over differences in Teff when considering relative properties of cool objects using these colours. Secondly, the previously noted apparent dominance of young objects in the late-T dwarf sample is no longer apparent when using the new model grids and the expanded sample of late-T dwarfs and benchmarks. This is supported by the apparently similar distribution of late-T dwarfs and earlier type T dwarfs on reduced proper motion diagrams that we present. Finally, we present updated space densities for the late-T dwarfs, and compare our values to simulation predictions and those from WISE.},

We developed two spectroscopic distance calibrations that use NIR spectral type or an index based on the curvature of the K-band continuum. Our distance calibration has a scatter of 14%. We searched 27 NIR spectral lines and 10 spectral indices for metallicity sensitive features, taking into account correlated noise in our estimates of the errors on these parameters. We calibrated our relation using 36 M dwarfs in common proper pairs with an F-, G-, or K-type star of known metallicity. We validated the physical association of these pairs using proper motions, radial velocities, and spectroscopic distance estimates. Our resulting metallicity calibration uses the sodium doublet at 2.2 mum as the sole indicator for metallicity. It has an accuracy of 0.12 dex inferred from the scatter between the metallicities of the primaries and the estimated metallicities of the secondaries. Our relation is valid for NIR spectral types from M1V to M5V and for --1.0 dex < [Fe/H] < +0.35 dex. We present a new color-color metallicity relation using J -- H and J -- K colors that directly relates two observables: the distance from the M dwarf main sequence and equivalent width of the sodium line at 2.2 mum. We used radial velocities of M dwarf binaries, observations at different epochs, and comparison between our measurements and precisely measured radial velocities to demonstrate a 4 km s--1 accuracy.},

	abstract = {The Gaia satellite will survey the entire celestial sphere down to 20th magnitude, obtaining astrometry, photometry, and low resolution spectrophotometry on one billion astronomical sources, plus radial velocities for over one hundred million stars. Itsmain objective is to take a census of the stellar content of our Galaxy, with the goal of revealing its formation and evolution. Gaia's unique feature is the measurement of parallaxes and proper motions with hitherto unparalleled accuracy for many objects. As a survey, the physical properties of most of these objects are unknown. Here we describe the data analysis system put together by the Gaia consortium to classify these objects and to infer their astrophysical properties using the satellite's data. This system covers single stars, (unresolved) binary stars, quasars, and galaxies, all covering a wide parameter space. Multiple methods are used for many types of stars, producing multiple results for the end user according to different models and assumptions. Prior to its application to real Gaia data the accuracy of these methods cannot be assessed definitively. But as an example of the current performance, we can attain internal accuracies (rms residuals) on F, G, K, M dwarfs and giants at G = 15 (V = 15-17) for a wide range of metallicites and interstellar extinctions of around 100 K in effective temperature (Teff), 0.1 mag in extinction (A0), 0.2 dex in metallicity ([Fe/H]), and 0.25 dex in surface gravity (log g). The accuracy is a strong function of the parameters themselves, varying by a factor of more than two up or down over this parameter range. After its launch in December 2013, Gaia will nominally observe for five years, during which the system we describe will continue to evolve in light of experience with the real data.},

@article{Berta2013,
	abstract = {The MEarth Project is a ground-based photometric survey intended to find planets transiting the closest and smallest main-sequence stars. In its first four years, MEarth discovered one transiting exoplanet, the 2.7 R ⊕ planet GJ1214b. Here, we answer an outstanding question: in light of the bounty of small planets transiting small stars uncovered by the Kepler mission, should MEarth have found more than just one planet so far? We estimate MEarth's ensemble sensitivity to exoplanets by performing end-to-end simulations of 1.25 × 106 observations of 988 nearby mid-to-late M dwarfs, gathered by MEarth between 2008 October and 2012 June. For 2-4 R ⊕ planets, we compare this sensitivity to results from Kepler and find that MEarth should have found planets at a rate of 0.05-0.36 planets yr-1 in its first four years. As part of this analysis, we provide new analytic fits to the Kepler early M dwarf planet occurrence distribution. When extrapolating between Kepler's early M dwarfs and MEarth's mid-to-late M dwarfs, we find that assuming the planet occurrence distribution stays fixed with respect to planetary equilibrium temperature provides a good match to our detection of a planet with GJ1214b's observed properties. For larger planets, we find that the warm (600-700 K), Neptune-sized (4 R ⊕) exoplanets that transit early M dwarfs like Gl436 and GJ3470 occur at a rate of <0.15 star-1 (at 95% confidence) around MEarth's later M dwarf targets. We describe a strategy with which MEarth can increase its expected planet yield by 2.5 × without new telescopes by shifting its sensitivity toward the smaller and cooler exoplanets that Kepler has demonstrated to be abundant.},

@article{Menou2013,
	abstract = {Although tidally locked habitable planets orbiting nearby M-dwarf stars are among the best astronomical targets to search for extrasolar life, they may also be deficient in volatiles and water. Climate models for this class of planets show atmospheric transport of water from the dayside to the nightside, where it is precipitated as snow and trapped as ice. Since ice only slowly flows back to the dayside upon accumulation, the resulting hydrological cycle can trap a large amount of water in the form of nightside ice. Using ice sheet dynamical and thermodynamical constraints, I illustrate how planets with less than about a quarter the Earth's oceans could trap most of their surface water on the nightside. This would leave their dayside, where habitable conditions are met, potentially dry. The amount and distribution of residual liquid water on the dayside depend on a variety of geophysical factors, including the efficiency of rock weathering at regulating atmospheric CO2 as dayside ocean basins dry up. Water-trapped worlds with dry daysides may offer similar advantages as land planets for habitability, by contrast with worlds where more abundant water freely flows around the globe.},

@article{Shields2013,
	abstract = {Planetary climate can be affected by the interaction of the host star spectral energy distribution with the wavelength-dependent reflectivity of ice and snow. Here we explore this effect using a one dimensional (1-D), line-by-line, radiative-transfer model to calculate broadband planetary albedos as input to a seasonally varying, 1-D energy-balance climate model. A three-dimensional general circulation model is also used to explore the atmosphere's response to changes in incoming stellar radiation, or instellation, and surface albedo. Using this hierarchy of models we simulate planets covered by ocean, land, and water ice of varying grain size, with incident radiation from stars of different spectral types. Terrestrial planets orbiting stars with higher near-UV radiation exhibit a stronger ice-albedo feedback. We find that ice-covered conditions occur on an F-dwarf planet with only a 2% reduction in instellation relative to the present instellation on Earth, assuming fixed CO2 (present atmospheric level on Earth). A similar planet orbiting the Sun at an equivalent flux distance requires an 8% reduction in instellation, while a planet orbiting an M-dwarf star requires an additional 19% reduction in instellation to become ice-covered, equivalent to 73% of the modern solar constant. The surface ice-albedo feedback effect becomes less important at the outer edge of the habitable zone, where atmospheric CO2 can be expected to be high in order to maintain clement conditions for surface liquid water. We show that 3-10 bars of CO2 will entirely mask the climatic effect of ice and snow, leaving the outer limits of the habitable zone unaffected by the spectral dependence of water ice and snow albedo. However, less CO2 is needed to maintain open water for a planet orbiting an M-dwarf star, than would be the case for hotter main-sequence stars.},

	abstract = {Aims: To investigate the universality hypothesis of the initial mass function in the substellar regime, the population of the rho Ophiuchi molecular cloud is analysed by including a new sample of low-mass spectroscopically confirmed members. To that end, we have conducted a large spectroscopic follow-up of young substellar candidates uncovered in our previous photometric survey.  Methods: The spectral types and extinction were derived for a newly found population of substellar objects, and its masses estimated by comparison to evolutionary models. A thoroughly literature search was conducted to provide an up-to-date census of the cluster, which was then used to derive the luminosity and mass functions, as well as the ratio of brown dwarfs to stars in the cluster. These results were then compared to other young clusters.  Results: It is shown that the study of the substellar population of the rho Ophiuchi molecular cloud is hampered only by the high extinction in the cluster ruling out an apparent paucity of brown dwarfs. The discovery of 16 new members of rho Ophiuchi, 13 of them in the substellar regime, reveals the low-mass end of its population and shows the success of our photometric candidate selection with the WIRCam survey. The study of the brown dwarf population of the cluster reveals a high disk fraction of 76-8+5%.  Conclusions: Taking the characteristic peak mass of the derived mass function and the ratio of brown dwarfs to stars into account, we conclude that the mass function of rho Ophiuchi is similar to other nearby young clusters.  Based on observations made at the ESO La Silla and Paranal Observatory under program 085.C-0960.},

@article{Caffau2011,
	abstract = {In the last decade, the photospheric solar metallicity as determined from spectroscopy experienced a remarkable downward revision. Part of this effect can be attributed to an improvement of atomic data and the inclusion of NLTE computations, but also the use of hydrodynamical model atmospheres seemed to play a role. This "decrease" with time of the metallicity of the solar photosphere increased the disagreement with the results from helioseismology. With a CO 5 BOLD 3D model of the solar atmosphere, the CIFIST team at the Paris Observatory re-determined the photospheric solar abundances of several elements, among them C, N, and O. The spectroscopic abundances are obtained by fitting the equivalent width and/or the profile of observed spectral lines with synthetic spectra computed from the 3D model atmosphere. We conclude that the effects of granular fluctuations depend on the characteristics of the individual lines, but are found to be relevant only in a few particular cases. 3D effects are not responsible for the systematic lowering of the solar abundances in recent years. The solar metallicity resulting from this analysis is Z=0.0153, Z/ X=0.0209.},

@article{Ballard:2013,
	abstract = {We present the validation and characterization of Kepler-61b: a 2.15 R ⊕ planet orbiting near the inner edge of the habitable zone of a low-mass star. Our characterization of the host star Kepler-61 is based upon a comparison with a set of spectroscopically similar stars with directly measured radii and temperatures. We apply a stellar prior drawn from the weighted mean of these properties, in tandem with the Kepler photometry, to infer a planetary radius for Kepler-61b of 2.15 $\pm$ 0.13 R ⊕ and an equilibrium temperature of 273 $\pm$ 13 K (given its period of 59.87756 $\pm$ 0.00020 days and assuming a planetary albedo of 0.3). The technique of leveraging the physical properties of nearby "proxy" stars allows for an independent check on stellar characterization via the traditional measurements with stellar spectra and evolutionary models. In this case, such a check had implications for the putative habitability of Kepler-61b: the planet is 10% warmer and larger than inferred from K-band spectral characterization. From the Kepler photometry, we estimate a stellar rotation period of 36 days, which implies a stellar age of >1 Gyr. We summarize the evidence for the planetary nature of the Kepler-61 transit signal, which we conclude is 30,000 times more likely to be due to a planet than a blend scenario. Finally, we discuss possible compositions for Kepler-61b with a comparison to theoretical models as well as to known exoplanets with similar radii and dynamically measured masses.},

@article{Johnson:1964,
	abstract = {The infrared photometric program that was begun in 1959 has been continued and the time has come for a fairly extensive report on the progress  of the work. This paper is divided into several sections, as follows: Observations. Photometric observations in ten wavelength bands, U, B, V, R, I,  J, K, L, M and N, have been made. Some of these observations were made with the 82-inch and 36-inch telescopes of the McDonald Observatory and others were made by B. Iriarte with the 40-inch telescope of the Observatorio Astron{\'o}mico Nacional of the University of Mexico but the majority were made with the 21-inch and 28-inch photometric telescopes of the Lunar and Planetary Laboratory (University of Arizona). Data for a total of 256 stars are given in this paper; of these, 241 have complete observations in U, B, V, R, I, J and K. Observations in L, M and N are given for a number of the brighter stars. For the R, I, J, K, L, M and N systems, the data here should be regarded as the standard values for additional photometric work. Intrinsic Colors of Stars. The data that are now available proved to be sufficient for the derivation of the intrinsic colors of many types of stars. These are giants of Luminosity Class III from G8 to M5, supergiants from O to M5 and main-sequence stars from O to K7. The intrinsic color-indices, U-V, B-V, V-R, V-I, V-J and V-K were derived for most types of stars within these ranges; in addition, V-L, V-M and V-N were derived for the ranges of spectral type and luminosity class for which data are available. Absolute Intensities and Bolometric Corrections. An absolute calibration procedure has made possible the derivation of the total energy outputs and these data were used to obtain the Bolometric Corrections for many types of stars for which intrinsic colors were derived. Effective Temperatures. The computed total energies have also been used, in conjunction with the apparent diameter measures that are available for ten stars, to derive the Effective Temperatures of many of the types of stars for which intrinsic colors are given. The Zero-Age Main Sequence (ZAMS) and Selected Stars. The Bolometric Corrections and Effective Temperatures were used to derive the M_{B} versus Log T_{e} diagram for the zero-age main sequence. This sequence has been extended to fainter stars by a number of M-dwarfs for which only R and R-I are yet available; however, the validity of this extension is open to question since there is some evidence that the few M-dwarfs that have so far been observed on this program may not be typical M-dwarfs, so far as their spectral-energy distributions are concerned. Three subdwarfs have been observed on this program; of these, two (tau Cet and Gmb 1830) have large trigonometric parallaxes. In the M_{B} versus Log T_{e} diagram, tau Cet falls exactly on the ZAMS while Gmb 1830 falls about 0.4 mag. below. Measures for the Future. The analysis of the present data has exposed three areas where more observational material is needed. These are: 1) We need more observations of M-dwarf stars in  U, B, V, R, I, J and K. 2) More measures of stellar angular diameters are sorely needed. The intensity interferometer of Brown and Twiss will help for the early-type stars, but a new Michelson interferometer is needed for the cooler stars. 3) We need more and better observations at wavelengths shorter than 0.3 microns. Such measures can be made only from above the Earth's atmosphere.},

	abstract = {Planets within the habitable zones of M dwarfs are likely to be synchronous rotators; in other words, one side is permanently illuminated while the other side is in perpetual darkness. We present results of three-dimensional simulations of the atmospheres of such planets, and comment on their possible habitability. Near the ground, a thermally direct longitudinal cell exists, transporting heat from the dayside to the nightside. The circulation is three-dimensional, with low-level winds returning mass to the dayside across the polar regions. Aloft, the zonally averaged winds display a pattern of strong superrotation due to these planets' finite (albeit small) rotation rate. With terrestrial values of insolation, a CO_2_solarH_2O atmosphere collapses, or condenses on the surface of the darkside, when surface pressure is approximately 30 mb, this value being much lower for a N_2 atmosphere. This temperature contrast is also sensitive to factors such as gravity, planetary radius, and IR optical depth tau. These results question the suitability of the concept of a habitable zone around M dwarfs that is independent of planetary parameters. If CO_2 partial pressure is controlled by the carbonate-silicate cycle, we find that these planets should have a minimum surface pressure of 1000-1500 mb of CO_2, as this is the minimum pressure needed to support stable liquid water on the darkside at the inner edge of the habitable zone. We finally conclude that planets orbiting M stars can support atmospheres over a large range of conditions and, despite constraints such as stellar activity, are very likely to be habitable.},

Smooth fluxes from 3300 to 10500 {\AA} are best determined by dividing the raw spectra of all objects taken in a night by the raw spectrum of a ``smooth'' spectrum star before deriving the instrumental response function using the revised standard star fluxes. In this way the telluric features and any large instrumental variation with wavelength are removed from the raw data, leaving smooth spectra that need only small corrections to place them on an absolute flux scale. These small corrections with wavelength are well described by a low-order polynomial and result in very smooth flux-calibrated spectra.},

@article{Feiden2012b,
	abstract = {We introduce a new one-dimensional stellar evolution code, based on the existing Dartmouth code, that self-consistently accounts for the presence of a globally pervasive magnetic field. The methods involved in perturbing the equations of stellar structure, the equation of state, and the mixing-length theory of convection are presented and discussed. As a first test of the code's viability, stellar evolution models are computed for the components of a solar-type, detached eclipsing binary (DEB) system, EF Aquarii, shown to exhibit large disagreements with stellar models. The addition of the magnetic perturbation corrects the radius and effective temperature discrepancies observed in EF Aquarii. Furthermore, the required magnetic field strength at the model photosphere is within a factor of two of the magnetic field strengths estimated from the stellar X-ray luminosities measured by ROSAT and those predicted from Ca II K line core emission. These models provide firm evidence that the suppression of thermal convection arising from the presence of a magnetic field is sufficient to significantly alter the structure of solar-type stars, producing noticeably inflated radii and cooler effective temperatures. The inclusion of magnetic effects within a stellar evolution model has a wide range of applications, from DEBs and exoplanet host stars to the donor stars of cataclysmic variables.},

	abstract = {We measure the mass of a modestly irradiated giant planet, KOI-94d. We wish to determine whether this planet, which is in a 22 day orbit and receives 2700 times as much incident flux as Jupiter, is as dense as Jupiter or rarefied like inflated hot Jupiters. KOI-94 also hosts at least three smaller transiting planets, all of which were detected by the Kepler mission. With 26 radial velocities of KOI-94 from the W. M. Keck Observatory and a simultaneous fit to the Kepler light curve, we measure the mass of the giant planet and determine that it is not inflated. Support for the planetary interpretation of the other three candidates comes from gravitational interactions through transit timing variations, the statistical robustness of multi-planet systems against false positives, and several lines of evidence that no other star resides within the photometric aperture. We report the properties of KOI-94b (M P = 10.5 $\pm$ 4.6 M ⊕, R P = 1.71 $\pm$ 0.16 R ⊕, P = 3.74 days), KOI-94c (M P = 15.6^{+5.7}_{-15.6} M ⊕, R P = 4.32 $\pm$ 0.41 R ⊕, P = 10.4 days), KOI-94d (M P = 106 $\pm$ 11 M ⊕, R P = 11.27 $\pm$ 1.06 R ⊕, P = 22.3 days), and KOI-94e (M P = 35^{+18}_{-28} M ⊕, R P = 6.56 $\pm$ 0.62 R ⊕, P = 54.3 days). The radial velocity analyses of KOI-94b and KOI-94e offer marginal (>2sigma) mass detections, whereas the observations of KOI-94c offer only an upper limit to its mass. Using the KOI-94 system and other planets with published values for both mass and radius (138 exoplanets total, including 35 with M P < 150 M ⊕), we establish two fundamental planes for exoplanets that relate their mass, incident flux, and radius from a few Earth masses up to 13 Jupiter masses: (R P/R ⊕) = 1.78(M P/M ⊕)0.53(F/erg s-1 cm-2)-0.03 for M P < 150 M ⊕, and R P/R ⊕ = 2.45(M P/M ⊕)-0.039(F/erg s-1 cm-2)0.094 for M P > 150 M ⊕. These equations can be used to predict the radius or mass of a planet.  Based in part on observations obtained at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated by the University of California and the California Institute of Technology.},

@article{Ford:2011dq,
	abstract = {The architectures of multiple planet systems can provide valuable constraints on models of planet formation, including orbital migration, and excitation of orbital eccentricities and inclinations. NASA's Kepler mission has identified 1235 transiting planet candidates. The method of transit timing variations (TTVs) has already confirmed seven planets in two planetary systems. We perform a transit timing analysis of the Kepler planet candidates. We find that at least ~11% of planet candidates currently suitable for TTV analysis show evidence suggestive of TTVs, representing at least ~65 TTV candidates. In all cases, the time span of observations must increase for TTVs to provide strong constraints on planet masses and/or orbits, as expected based on N-body integrations of multiple transiting planet candidate systems (assuming circular and coplanar orbits). We find the fraction of planet candidates showing TTVs in this data set does not vary significantly with the number of transiting planet candidates per star, suggesting significant mutual inclinations and that many stars with a single transiting planet should host additional non-transiting planets. We anticipate that Kepler could confirm (or reject) at least ~12 systems with multiple transiting planet candidates via TTVs. Thus, TTVs will provide a powerful tool for confirming transiting planets and characterizing the orbital dynamics of low-mass planets. If Kepler observations were extended to at least seven years, then TTVs would provide much more precise constraints on the dynamics of systems with multiple transiting planets and would become sensitive to planets with orbital periods extending into the habitable zone of solar-type stars.},

	abstract = {The late-type dwarf GJ 436 is known to host a transiting Neptune-mass planet in a 2.6 day orbit. We present results of our interferometric measurements to directly determine the stellar diameter (R sstarf = 0.455 $\pm$ 0.018 R &sun;) and effective temperature (T EFF = 3416 $\pm$ 54 K). We combine our stellar parameters with literature time-series data, which allows us to calculate physical and orbital system parameters, including GJ 436's stellar mass (M sstarf = 0.507+0.071 - 0.062 M &sun;), stellar density (rho* = 5.37+0.30 - 0.27 rho&sun;), planetary radius (Rp = 0.369+0.015 - 0.015 R Jupiter), and planetary mass (Mp = 0.078+0.007 - 0.008 M Jupiter), implying a mean planetary density of rho p  = 1.55+0.12 - 0.10 rhoJupiter. These values are generally in good agreement with previous literature estimates based on assumed stellar mass and photometric light curve fitting. Finally, we examine the expected phase curves of the hot Neptune GJ 436b, based on various assumptions concerning the efficiency of energy redistribution in the planetary atmosphere, and find that it could be constrained with Spitzer monitoring observations.},

	abstract = {GJ 581 is an M dwarf host of a multiplanet system. We use long-baseline interferometric measurements from the CHARA Array, coupled with trigonometric parallax information, to directly determine its physical radius to be 0.299 $\pm$ 0.010 R sun. Literature photometry data are used to perform spectral energy distribution fitting in order to determine GJ 581's effective surface temperature T EFF = 3498 $\pm$ 56 K and its luminosity L = 0.01205 $\pm$ 0.00024 L sun. From these measurements, we recompute the location and extent of the system's habitable zone and conclude that two of the planets orbiting GJ 581, planets d and g, spend all or part of their orbit within or just on the edge of the habitable zone.},

	abstract = {We present interferometric angular sizes for 12 stars with known planetary companions, for comparison with 28 additional main-sequence stars not known to host planets. For all objects we estimate bolometric fluxes and reddenings through spectral-energy distribution (SED) fits, and in conjunction with the angular sizes, measurements of effective temperature. The angular sizes of these stars are sufficiently small that the fundamental resolution limits of our primary instrument, the Palomar Testbed Interferometer, are investigated at the sub-milliarcsecond level and empirically established based upon known performance limits. We demonstrate that the effective temperature scale as a function of dereddened (V - K)0 color is statistically identical for stars with and without planets. A useful byproduct of this investigation is a direct calibration of the T EFF scale for solarlike stars, as a function of both spectral type and (V - K)0 color, with an precision of \overline{Delta T}_{(V-K)_0} = 138 K over the range (V - K)0 = 0.0-4.0 and \overline{Delta T}_{SpType} = 105 K for the range F6V-G5V. Additionally, in an Appendix we provide SED fits for the 166 stars with known planets which have sufficient photometry available in the literature for such fits; this derived "XO-Rad" database includes homogeneous estimates of bolometric flux, reddening, and angular size.},

Spectra of 14 giant and higher luminosity star are presented from 6900 to 9000 A, along with two miscellaneous spectra. Also given is an extensive list of atomic and molecular features found in the spectra of late K and M stars of all luminosity classes. From the spectral slopes and the strengths of the red/near-infrared spectral features it is possible to distinguish giants from dwarfs and to classify M dwarfs of all spectral subclasses. The library of spectra has been used to construct a spectral class versus mass relation which allows mass estimates to be made based upon a dwarf's spectral class alone. The relation is based on eight objects having both well-determined masses and spectral types.},

@article{Gaidos2013b,
	abstract = {Analyses of exoplanet statistics suggest a trend of giant planet occurrence with host star mass, a clue to how planets like Jupiter form. One missing piece of the puzzle is the occurrence around late K dwarf stars (masses of 0.5-0.75 M &sun; and effective temperatures of 3900-4800 K). We analyzed four years of Doppler radial velocity (RVs) data for 110 late K dwarfs, one of which hosts two previously reported giant planets. We estimate that 4.0% $\pm$ 2.3% of these stars have Saturn-mass or larger planets with orbital periods <245 days, depending on the planet mass distribution and RV variability of stars without giant planets. We also estimate that 0.7% $\pm$ 0.5% of similar stars observed by Kepler have giant planets. This Kepler rate is significantly (99% confidence) lower than that derived from our Doppler survey, but the difference vanishes if only the single Doppler system (HIP 57274) with completely resolved orbits is considered. The difference could also be explained by the exclusion of close binaries (without giant planets) from the Doppler but not Kepler surveys, the effect of long-period companions and stellar noise on the Doppler data, or an intrinsic difference between the two populations. Our estimates for late K dwarfs bridge those for solar-type stars and M dwarfs, and support a positive trend with stellar mass. Small sample size precludes statements about finer structure, e.g., a "shoulder" in the distribution of giant planets with stellar mass. Future surveys such as the Next Generation Transit Survey and the Transiting Exoplanet Satellite Survey will ameliorate this deficiency.},

	abstract = {We present a substantial extension of the millimeter (mm) wave continuum photometry catalog for circumstellar dust disks in the Taurus star-forming region, based on a new "snapshot" lambda = 1.3 mm survey with the Submillimeter Array. Combining these new data with measurements in the literature, we construct a mm-wave luminosity distribution, f(L mm), for Class II disks that is statistically complete for stellar hosts with spectral types earlier than M8.5 and has a 3sigma depth of roughly 3 mJy. The resulting census eliminates a longstanding selection bias against disks with late-type hosts, and thereby demonstrates that there is a strong correlation between L mm and the host spectral type. By translating the locations of individual stars in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram into masses and ages, and adopting a simple conversion between L mm and the disk mass, Md , we confirm that this correlation corresponds to a statistically robust relationship between the masses of dust disks and the stars that host them. A Bayesian regression technique is used to characterize these relationships in the presence of measurement errors, data censoring, and significant intrinsic scatter: the best-fit results indicate a typical 1.3 mm flux density of ~25 mJy for 1 M &sun; hosts and a power-law scaling L_mm ∝ M_{\ast}^{1.5-2.0}. We suggest that a reasonable treatment of dust temperature in the conversion from L mm to Md favors an inherently linear Md vpropM changed_arxiv py.py scpt.scpt scaling, with a typical disk-to-star mass ratio of ~0.2%-0.6%. The measured rms dispersion around this regression curve is $\pm$0.7 dex, suggesting that the combined effects of diverse evolutionary states, dust opacities, and temperatures in these disks imprint a full width at half-maximum range of a factor of ~40 on the inferred Md (or L mm) at any given host mass. We argue that this relationship between Md and M changed_arxiv py.py scpt.scpt likely represents the origin of the inferred correlation between giant planet frequency and host star mass in the exoplanet population, and provides some basic support for the core accretion model for planet formation. Moreover, we caution that the effects of incompleteness and selection bias must be considered in comparative studies of disk evolution, and illustrate that fact with statistical comparisons of f(L mm) between the Taurus catalog presented here and incomplete subsamples in the Ophiuchus, IC 348, and Upper Sco young clusters.},

	abstract = {Stellar properties are measured for a large set of Kepler mission exoplanet candidate host stars. Most of these stars are fainter than 14th magnitude, in contrast to other spectroscopic follow-up studies. This sample includes many high-priority Earth-sized candidate planets. A set of model spectra are fitted to R ~ 3000 optical spectra of 268 stars to improve estimates of T eff, log (g), and [Fe/H] for the dwarfs in the range 4750 <= T eff <= 7200 K. These stellar properties are used to find new stellar radii and, in turn, new radius estimates for the candidate planets. The result of improved stellar characteristics is a more accurate representation of this Kepler exoplanet sample and identification of promising candidates for more detailed study. This stellar sample, particularly among stars with T eff >~ 5200 K, includes a greater number of relatively evolved stars with larger radii than assumed by the mission on the basis of multi-color broadband photometry. About 26% of the modeled stars require radii to be revised upward by a factor of 1.35 or greater, and modeling of 87% of the stars suggest some increase in radius. The sample presented here also exhibits a change in the incidence of planets larger than 3-4 R ⊕ as a function of metallicity. Once [Fe/H] increases to >= - 0.05, large planets suddenly appear in the sample while smaller planets are found orbiting stars with a wider range of metallicity. The modeled stellar spectra, as well as an additional 84 stars of mostly lower effective temperatures, are made available to the community.},

@article{Mohanty:2003qy,
	abstract = {We analyze rotation velocities and chromospheric (Halpha) activity, derived from high-resolution spectra, in a large sample of mid-M to L field dwarfs. The projected rotation velocity is found to increase from mid-M to L. This is consistent with a lengthening of spin-down timescale with later type, although in the L types the trend may also be a function of the observational bias toward younger objects. From M4 to M8.5 a saturation-type rotation-activity relation is seen, similar to that in earlier types, when activity is measured through either FHalpha or LHalpha/Lbol. However, we find that activity saturates at a significantly higher velocity (~10 km s-1) in the M5.5-M8.5 dwarfs than in the M4-M5 ones (<~4 km s-1). This may result from a change in the dynamo behavior with later type (see also below). We note that the saturation level in Halpha emission appears to vary somewhat less with spectral type (from M4 to M8.5) when activity is measured through LHalpha/Lbol instead of FHalpha. In M9 and later dwarfs, we observe a drastic drop in activity and a sharp break in the rotation-activity connection: Halpha emission levels in these dwarfs are much lower than in earlier types, and often undetectable, in spite of very rapid rotation. This may be caused by the very high resistivities in the predominantly neutral atmospheres of these dwarfs, which would damp the magnetic energy available for supporting a chromosphere. It is also possible that the rapid formation of dust in these cool atmospheres exacerbates this effect, as charged particles are soaked up by (more massive) dust grains. Finally, we note that spectral type determination from low-resolution spectra may be affected by gravity effects: cooler, lower gravity objects may mimic hotter, higher gravity ones. Therefore, it is possible that the few unsaturated fast rotators from M5.5 to M8.5 (whose presence leads us to ascribe a higher saturation velocity to these spectral types, as noted above) may actually be very low mass objects, with lower Teff (and gravity) than their spectral types suggest. If so, their behavior (low activity, fast rotation) would be compatible with that of the cool M9 and later dwarfs (and no change in dynamo behavior would have to be postulated in the M5.5-M8.5 dwarfs). This interpretation is supported by a preliminary analysis of the high-resolution spectra of these anomolous objects. It is also bolstered by the fact that a saturation-type Rossby number-activity relation is seen in the M5.5-M8.5 dwarfs when these anomalous objects are removed from the sample, while the relationship is much weaker when they are included.},

	abstract = {The Palomar Testbed Interferometer (PTI) archive of observations between 1998 and 2005 is examined for objects appropriate for calibration of optical long-baseline interferometer observations-stars that are predictably pointlike and single. Approximately 1400 nights of data on 1800 objects were examined for this investigation. We compare those observations to an intensively studied object that is a suitable calibrator, HD 217014, and statistically compare each candidate calibrator to that object by computing both a Mahalanobis distance and a principal component analysis. Our hypothesis is that the frequency distribution of visibility data associated with calibrator stars differs from noncalibrator stars such as binary stars. Spectroscopic binaries resolved by PTI, objects known to be unsuitable for calibrator use, are similarly tested to establish detection limits of this approach. From this investigation, we find more than 350 observed stars suitable for use as calibrators (with an additional ~140 being rejected), corresponding to >~95% sky coverage for PTI. This approach is noteworthy in that it rigorously establishes calibration sources through a traceable, empirical methodology, leveraging the predictions of spectral energy distribution modeling but also verifying it with the rich body of PTI's on-sky observations.},

	abstract = {We use new interior models of cold planets to investigate the mass-radius relationships of solid exoplanets, considering planets made primarily of iron, silicates, water, and carbon compounds. We find that the mass-radius relationships for cold terrestrial mass planets of all compositions we considered follow a generic functional form that is not a simple power law: log10Rs=k1+1/3log10(Ms)-k2Mk3s for up to Mp~20 M⊕, where Ms and Rs are scaled mass and radius values. This functional form arises because the common building blocks of solid planets all have equations of state that are well approximated by a modified polytrope of the form rho=rho0+cPn. We find that highly detailed planet interior models, including temperature structure and phase changes, are not necessary to derive solid exoplanet bulk composition from mass and radius measurements. For solid exoplanets with no substantial atmosphere we have also found the following: with 5% fractional uncertainty in planet mass and radius it is possible to distinguish among planets composed predominantly of iron or silicates or water ice but not more detailed compositions; with ~5% uncertainty water ice planets with >~25% water by mass may be identified; the minimum plausible planet size for a given mass is that of a pure iron planet; and carbon planet mass-radius relationships overlap with those of silicate and water planets due to similar zero-pressure densities and equations of state. We propose a definition of ``super-Earths'' based on the clear distinction in radii between planets with significant gas envelopes and those without.},

	abstract = {We investigate a population of transiting planets that receive relatively modest stellar insolation, indicating equilibrium temperatures <1000 K, and for which the heating mechanism that inflates hot Jupiters does not appear to be significantly active. We use structural evolution models to infer the amount of heavy elements within each of these planets. There is a correlation between the stellar metallicity and the mass of heavy elements in its transiting planet(s). It appears that all giant planets possess a minimum of ~10-15 Earth masses of heavy elements, with planets around metal-rich stars having larger heavy-element masses. There is also an inverse relationship between the mass of the planet and the metal enrichment (Z pl/Z star), which appears to have little dependency on the metallicity of the star. Saturn- and Jupiter-like enrichments above solar composition are a hallmark of all the gas giants in the sample, even planets of several Jupiter masses. These relationships provide an important constraint on planet formation and suggest large amounts of heavy elements within planetary H/He envelopes. We suggest that the observed correlation can soon also be applied to inflated planets, such that the interior heavy-element abundance of these planets could be estimated, yielding better constraints on their interior energy sources. We point to future directions for planetary population synthesis models and suggest future correlations. This appears to be the first evidence that extrasolar giant planets, as a class, are enhanced in heavy elements.},

	abstract = {The minimum-mass solar nebula (MMSN) model estimates the surface density distribution of the protoplanetary disk by assuming the planets to have formed in situ. However, significant radial migration of the giant planets likely occurred in the solar system, implying a distortion in the values derived by the MMSN method. The true density profiles of protoplanetary disks is therefore uncertain. Here we present results of simulations of late-stage terrestrial accretion, each starting from a disk of planetary embryos. We assume a power-law surface density profile that scales with heliocentric distance r as r-alpha and vary alpha between 1/2 and 5/2 (alpha=3/2 for the MMSN model). We find that for steeper profiles (higher values of alpha), the terrestrial planets (1) are more numerous, (2) form more quickly, (3) form closer to the star, (4) are more massive, (5) have higher iron contents, and (6) have lower water contents. However, the possibility of forming potentially habitable planets does not appear to vary strongly with alpha.},

	abstract = {To date, two planetary systems have been discovered with close-in, terrestrial-mass planets . Many more such discoveries are anticipated in the coming years with radial velocity and transit searches. Here we investigate the different mechanisms that could form `hot Earths' and their observable predictions. Models include: (1) in situ accretion; (2) formation at larger orbital distance followed by inward `type 1' migration; (3) formation from material being `shepherded' inward by a migrating gas giant planet; (4) formation from material being shepherded by moving secular resonances during dispersal of the protoplanetary disc; (5) tidal circularization of eccentric terrestrial planets with close-in perihelion distances and (6) photoevaporative mass-loss of a close-in giant planet. Models 1-4 have been validated in previous work. We show that tidal circularization can form hot Earths, but only for relatively massive planets with very close-in perihelion distances (<~0.025 au), and even then the net inward movement in orbital distance is at most only 0.1-0.15 au. For planets of less than , photoevaporation can remove the planet's envelope and leave behind the solid core on a Gyr time-scale, but only for planets inside 0.025-0.05 au. Using two quantities that are observable by current and upcoming missions, we show that these models each produce unique signatures, and can be observationally distinguished. These observables are the planetary system architecture (detectable with radial velocities, transits and transit timing) and the bulk composition of transiting close-in terrestrial planets (measured by transits via the planet's radius).},

	abstract = {Kepler has found hundreds of Neptune-size (2-6 R ⊕) planet candidates within 0.5 AU of their stars. The nature of the vast majority of these planets is not known because their masses have not been measured. Using theoretical models of planet formation, evolution, and structure, we explore the range of minimum plausible masses for low-density exo-Neptunes. We focus on highly irradiated planets with T eq >= 500 K. We consider two separate formation pathways for low-mass planets with voluminous atmospheres of light gases: core-nucleated accretion and outgassing of hydrogen from dissociated ices. We show that Neptune-size planets at T eq = 500 K with masses as small as a few times that of Earth can plausibly be formed by core-nucleated accretion coupled with subsequent inward migration. We also derive a limiting low-density mass-radius relation for rocky planets with outgassed hydrogen envelopes but no surface water. Rocky planets with outgassed hydrogen envelopes typically have computed radii well below 3 R ⊕. For both planets with H/He envelopes from core-nucleated accretion and planets with outgassed hydrogen envelopes, we employ planet interior models to map the range of planet mass-envelope mass-equilibrium temperature parameter space that is consistent with Neptune-size planet radii. Atmospheric mass loss mediates which corners of this parameter space are populated by actual planets and ultimately governs the minimum plausible mass at a specified transit radius. We find that Kepler's 2-6 R ⊕ planet candidates at T eq = 500-1000 K could potentially have masses <~ 4 M ⊕. Although our quantitative results depend on several assumptions, our qualitative finding that warm Neptune-size planets can have masses substantially smaller than those given by interpolating the masses and radii of planets within our Solar System is robust.},

	abstract = {Aims: The aim of this work is the study of the planet-metallicity and the planet-stellar mass correlations for M dwarfs from the HARPS GTO M dwarf subsample. Methods: We use a new method that takes advantage of the HARPS high-resolution spectra to increase the precision of metallicity, using previous photometric calibrations of [Fe/H] and effective temperature as starting values. Results: In this work we use our new calibration (rms = 0.08 dex) to study the planet-metallicity relation of our sample. The well-known correlation for giant planet FGKM hosts with metallicity is present. Regarding Neptunians and smaller hosts no correlation is found but there is a hint that an anti-correlation with [Fe/H] may exist. We combined our sample with the California Planet Survey late-K and M-type dwarf sample to increase our statistics but found no new trends. We fitted a power law to the frequency histogram of the Jovian hosts for our sample and for the combined sample, fp = C10alpha [Fe/H] , using two different approaches: a direct bin fitting and a Bayesian fitting procedure. We obtained a value for C between 0.02 and 0.04 and for alpha between 1.26 and 2.94. Regarding stellar mass, an hypothetical correlation with planets was discovered, but was found to be the result of a detection bias.

It is shown that the orbital migration of a protoplanet does not suppress the tendency for tidal truncation in the vicinity of its orbit. If the necessary condition for tidal truncation is satisfied, the protoplanet induces a tidal feedback mechanism that regulates the rate of angular momentum transfer between the protoplanet and the disk. Significant orbital migration can only occur on the viscous evolution time scale of the disk.},

	abstract = {We present Spitzer/IRAC 4.5 mum transit photometry of GJ 3470 b, a Neptune-size planet orbiting an M1.5 dwarf star with a 3.3 day period recently discovered in the course of the HARPS M-dwarf survey. We refine the stellar parameters by employing purely empirical mass-luminosity and surface brightness relations constrained by our updated value for the mean stellar density, and additional information from new near-infrared spectroscopic observations. We derive a stellar mass of M_{\star } = 0.539^{+0.047}_{-0.043} \,M_{\odot } and a radius of R_{\star } = 0.568^{+0.037}_{-0.031}\,R_{\odot }. We determine the host star of GJ 3470 b to be metal-rich, with a metallicity of [Fe/H] = +0.20 $\pm$ 0.10 and an effective temperature of T eff = 3600 $\pm$ 100 K. The revised stellar parameters yield a planetary radius R_{p} = 4.83_{-0.21}^{+0.22}\,R_{\oplus } that is 13% larger than the value previously reported in the literature. We find a planetary mass M_{p} = 13.9^{+1.5}_{-1.4}\,M_{\oplus } that translates to a very low planetary density, \rho _{p}= 0.72^{+0.13}_{-0.12} g cm--3, which is 33% smaller than the original value. With a mean density half of that of GJ 436 b, GJ 3470 b is an example of a very low-density low-mass planet, similar to Kepler-11 d, Kepler-11 e, and Kepler-18 c, but orbiting a much brighter nearby star that is more conducive to follow-up studies.  This paper includes data gathered with the 6.5 m Magellan Telescopes located at Las Campanas Observatory, Chile.},

	abstract = {Super-Earths, a class of planetary bodies with masses ranging from a few Earth-masses to slightly smaller than Uranus, have recently found a special place in the exoplanetary science. Being slightly larger than a typical terrestrial planet, super-Earths may have physical and dynamical characteristics similar to those of Earth whereas unlike terrestrial planets, they are relatively easier to detect. Because of their sizes, super-Earths can maintain moderate atmospheres and possibly dynamic interiors with plate tectonics. They also seem to be more common around low-mass stars where the habitable zone is in closer distances. This article presents a review of the current state of research on super-Earths, and discusses the models of the formation, dynamical evolution, and possible habitability of these objects. Given the recent advances in detection techniques, the detectability of super-Earths is also discussed, and a review of the prospects of their detection in the habitable zones of low-mass stars is presented.},

	abstract = {The extreme outer Galaxy (EOG), the region with a Galactic radius of more than 18 kpc, is known to have a very low metallicity, about one-tenth that of the solar neighborhood. We obtained the deep near-infrared (NIR) images of two very young (~0.5 Myr) star-forming clusters that are two of the most distant embedded clusters in the EOG. We find that in both clusters the fraction of stars with NIR excess, which originates from the circumstellar dust disk at radii of <=0.1 AU, is significantly lower than those in the solar neighborhood. Our results suggest that most of the stars forming in the low-metallicity environment experience disk dispersal at an earlier stage (<1 Myr) than those forming in the solar metallicity environment (as much as ~5-6 Myr). Such a rapid disk dispersal may make the formation of planets difficult, and the shorter disk lifetime with a lower metallicity, could contribute to the strong metallicity dependence of the well-known "planet-metallicity correlation," which states that the probability of a star hosting a planet increases steeply with stellar metallicity. The reason for the rapid disk dispersal could be the increase of the mass accretion rate and/or the effective far-ultraviolet photoevaporation due to the low extinction; however, another unknown mechanism for the EOG environment could be contributing significantly.  Based on data collected at Subaru telescope, which is operated by the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan.},

@article{Barnes:2007lr,
	abstract = {It is shown herein that planets with eccentric orbits are more likely to transit than circularly orbiting planets with the same semimajor axis by a factor of (1-e2)-1. If the orbital parameters of discovered transiting planets are known, as from follow-up radial velocity observations, then the transit-detected planet population is easily debiased of this effect. The duration of a planet's transit depends on its eccentricity and longitude of periastron; transits near periastron are shorter, and those near apoastron last longer, for a given impact parameter. If fitting for the stellar radius with the other transit parameters, this effect causes a systematic error in the resulting measurements. If the stellar radius is instead held fixed at a value measured independently, then it is possible to place a lower limit on the planet's eccentricity using photometry alone. Orbital accelerations cause a difference in the planet's ingress and egress durations that lead to an asymmetry in the transit light curve that could be used along with the transit velocity measurement to uniquely measure the planet's eccentricity and longitude of periapsis. However, the effect is too small to be measured with current technology. The habitability of transiting terrestrial planets found by Kepler depends on those planets' orbital eccentricities. While Kepler will be able to place lower limits on those planets' orbital eccentricity, the actual value for any given planet will likely remain unknown.},

@article{Fabrycky:2007ys,
	abstract = {At least two arguments suggest that the orbits of a large fraction of binary stars and extrasolar planets shrank by 1-2 orders of magnitude after formation: (1) the physical radius of a star shrinks by a large factor from birth to the main sequence, yet many main-sequence stars have companions orbiting only a few stellar radii away, and (2) in current theories of planet formation, the region within ~0.1 AU of a protostar is too hot and rarefied for a Jupiter-mass planet to form, yet many ``hot Jupiters'' are observed at such distances. We investigate orbital shrinkage by the combined effects of secular perturbations from a distant companion star (Kozai oscillations) and tidal friction. We integrate the relevant equations of motion to predict the distribution of orbital elements produced by this process. Binary stars with orbital periods of 0.1-10 days, with a median of ~2 days, are produced from binaries with much longer periods (10 to ~105 days), consistent with observations indicating that most or all short-period binaries have distant companions (tertiaries). We also make two new testable predictions: (1) For periods between 3 and 10 days, the distribution of the mutual inclination between the inner binary and the tertiary orbit should peak strongly near 40$\,^{\circ}$ and 140$\,^{\circ}$. (2) Extrasolar planets whose host stars have a distant binary companion may also undergo this process, in which case the orbit of the resulting hot Jupiter will typically be misaligned with the equator of its host star.  This work is dedicated to the late Bohdan Paczynski, who inspired it.},

@article{Wu:2003rt,
	abstract = {The exosolar planet HD 80606b has a highly eccentric (e=0.93) and tight (a=0.47 AU) orbit. We study how it might arrive at such an orbit and how it has avoided being tidally circularized until now. The presence of a stellar companion to the host star suggests the possibility that the Kozai mechanism and tidal dissipation combined to draw the planet inward well after it formed: Kozai oscillations produce periods of extreme eccentricity in the planet orbit, and the tidal dissipation that occurs during these periods of small pericenter distances leads to gradual orbital decay. We call this migration mechanism the ``Kozai migration.'' It requires that the initial planet orbit be highly inclined relative to the binary orbit. For a companion at 1000 AU and an initial planet orbit at 5 AU, the minimum relative inclination required is ~85$\,^{\circ}$. We discuss the efficiency of tidal dissipation inferred from the observations of exoplanets. Moreover, we investigate possible explanations for the velocity residual (after the motion induced by the planet is removed) observed on the host star: a second planet in the system is excluded over a large extent of semimajor axis space if Kozai migration is to work, and the tide raised on the star by HD 80606b is likely too small in amplitude. Last, we discuss the relevance of Kozai migration for other planetary systems.},

	abstract = {We review the observed properties of exoplanets found by the Doppler technique that has revealed 152 planets to date.  We focus on the ongoing 18-year survey of 1330 FGKM type stars at Lick, Keck, and the Anglo-Australian Telescopes that offers both uniform Doppler precision (3 m s-1) and long duration.  The 104 planets detected in this survey have minimum masses (M sin i) as low as 6 MEarth, orbiting between 0.02 and 6 AU.  The core-accretion model of planet formation is supported by four observations: 1) The mass distribution rises toward the lowest detectable masses, dN/dM ∝ M-1.0. 2) Stellar metallicity correlates strongly with the presence of planets. 3) One planet (1.3 MSat) has a massive rocky core, MCore ≈ 70 MEarth.  4) A super-Earth of ˜ 7 MEarth has been discovered.  The distribution of semi-major axes rises from 0.3 -- 3.0 AU (dN/d log a) and extrapolation suggests that ˜12% of the FGK stars harbor gas-giant exoplanets within 20 AU.  The median orbital eccentricity is < e > = 0.25, and even planets beyond 3 AU reside in eccentric orbits, suggesting that the circular orbits in our Solar System are unusual.  The occurrence ``hot Jupiters'' within 0.1 AU of FGK stars is 1.2 $\pm$ 0.2%.  Among stars with one planet, 14% have at least one additional planet, occasionally locked in resonances.  Kepler and COROT will measure the occurrence of earth-sized planets. The Space Interferometry Mission (SIM) will detect planets with masses as low as 3 MEarth orbiting within 2 AU of stars within 10 pc, and it will measure masses, orbits, and multiplicity.  The candidate rocky planets will be amenable to follow-up spectroscopy by the ``Terrestrial Planet Finder'' and Darwin.},

	abstract = {An extremely low mass companion to the solar-type star 70 Virginis is inferred from the observed periodic Doppler reflex motion of the primary during 8 yr. The minimum mass (M2 sin i) of 70 Vir "B" is 6.6 Jovian masses (MJ), which falls in the mass range associated with "extrasolar giant planets" (0.3--15 MJ). An orbital fit to the velocities yields a period P = 116.6 days, an amplitude K = 318 m s-1, and an eccentricity e = 0.40. The residuals to the fit scatter by 8 m s-1, consistent with the errors. Thus 70 Vir B and 51 Peg B represent the first planets found outside our solar system. Alternatively, the probability that 70 Vir B is an orbiting brown dwarf of mass M > 40 MJ is ~1%, requiring an extreme (face-on) orbital inclination of i < 9 deg. With a likely mass of 6.6--9 MJ, 70 Vir B lies in the nebulously defined domain between solar system planets and brown dwarfs. Its effective temperature is computed to be ~90 degC. The formation of such giant planets in eccentric orbits is not explained by current theory.},

The residuals scatter by 11 m s-1 from a Keplerian fit to the 34 velocity measurements obtained during 8 yr. The minimum mass of the unseen companion is M2 sin i = 2.39 MJ, and for likely orbital inclinations of 30 deg--90 deg, its mass is less than 4.8 MJ. This mass resides in a regime associated with extrasolar giant planets (Burrows and coworkers). Unlike the planet candidates 70 Vir B and 51 Peg B, this companion has an orbital radius (2.1 AU) and eccentricity (e = 0.03) reminiscent of giant planets in our solar system. Its effective temperature will be at least 180 K due simply to absorbed stellar radiation, and probably slightly higher due to intrinsic heating from gravitational contraction (Guillot and coworkers). For 47 UMa B to be, instead, an orbiting brown dwarf of mass M > 40 MJ, the inclination would have to be i < 3.dg4, which occurs for only 0.18% of randomly oriented orbits. In any case, this companion is separated from the primary star by ~0."2, which portends follow-up work by astrometric and direct IR techniques.},

@article{Figueira2012,
	abstract = {Context. The recent results of the HARPS and Kepler surveys provided us with a bounty of extrasolar systems. While the two teams extensively analyzed each of their data-sets, little work has been done comparing the two. Aims: We study a subset of the planetary population whose characterization is simultaneously within reach of both instruments. We compare the statistical properties of planets in systems with msini > 5-10 M⊕ and R > 2 R⊕, as inferred from the HARPS and Kepler surveys, respectively. If we assume that the underlying population has the same characteristics, the different detection sensitivity to the orbital inclination relative to the line of sight allows us to probe the planets' mutual inclination. Methods: We considered the frequency of systems with one, two, and three planets as dictated by HARPS data. We used Kepler's planetary period and host mass and radius distributions (corrected from detection bias) to model planetary systems in a simple, yet physically plausible way. We then varied the mutual inclination between planets in a system according to different prescriptions (completely aligned, Rayleigh distributions, and isotropic) and compared the transit frequencies with one, two, or three planets with those measured by Kepler. Results: The results show that the two datasets are compatible, a remarkable result especially because there are no tunable knobs other than the assumed inclination distribution. For msini cutoffs of 7-10 M⊕, which are those expected to correspond to the radius cutoff of 2 R⊕, we conclude that the results are better described by a Rayleigh distribution with a mode of 1$\,^{\circ}$ or smaller. We show that the best-fit scenario only becomes a Rayleigh distribution with a mode of 5$\,^{\circ}$ if we assume a quite extreme mass-radius relationship for the planetary population. Conclusions: These results have important consequences for our understanding of the role of several proposed formation and evolution mechanisms. They confirm that planets are likely to have been formed in a disk and show that most planetary systems evolve quietly without strong angular momentum exchanges such as those produced by Kozai mechanism or planet scattering.},

@article{Hartmann:1998fk,
	abstract = {Using results and calibrations from a previous paper (Gullbring et al. 1997), we estimate disk accretion rates for pre-main-sequence stars in the Taurus and Chamaeleon I molecular cloud complexes. The median accretion rate for T Tauri stars of age ~1 Myr is ~10-8 M&sun;  yr-1; the intrinsic scatter at a given age may be as large as 1  order of magnitude. There is a clear decline of mass accretion rates  M&sun; with increasing age t among T Tauri stars. Representing this  decline as M&sun; ~t-eta, we estimate 1.5 ≲ eta ≲ 2.8; the large uncertainty is due to the wide range of accretion rates  at a given age, the limited age range of the sample, and errors in estimating  stellar ages and accretion luminosities. Adopting values of eta near the low  end of this range, which are more likely given probable errors and the neglect  of birthline age corrections, masses accreted during the T Tauri phase are roughly consistent with disk masses estimated from millimeter-wave dust emission. Similarity solutions for evolving, expanding disks are used to investigate observational constraints on disk properties employing a minimum of parameters. For an assumed power-law form of the disk viscosity with radius nu ~ Rgamma, eta≳ 1.5 corresponds to  gamma ≳ 1. The limit gamma ~ 1 corresponds to a roughly  constant "alpha" in the Shakura-Sunyaev (1973) viscosity parameterization;  using current observed disk sizes, we estimate alpha ~ 10-2  (on scales ~10-100 AU).  Much of the observed variation in mass accretion  rates can be accounted for by varying initial disk masses between 0.01 and 0.2  M&sun;, but this result may be strongly affected by the presence of binary  companion stars. These results emphasize the need for older samples of stars  for studying disk evolution.},

	abstract = {We have carried out sensitive 1.3 mm observations of 20 young brown dwarfs in the Taurus star-forming region, representing the largest sample of young substellar objects targeted in a deep millimeter-continuum survey to date. Under standard assumptions, the masses of brown dwarf disks range from <~0.4 to several Jupiter masses. Their relative disk masses are comparable to those derived for coeval low-mass stars; most of them are in the <~1%-5% range, and there is no clear change of relative disk mass with object mass from 0.015 to 3 Msolar. Specifically, we do not find evidence for disk truncation, as would be expected in the ejection scenario for brown dwarf origin, although the signature of ejection may be hidden in our nondetections. We use the millimeter fluxes, complemented by mid-infrared data from the Spitzer Space Telescope to construct spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for six of our sources, and model those SEDs with a Monte Carlo radiative transfer code. We find that the SEDs in the mid-infrared often exhibit lower flux levels than predicted by hydrostatic models, implying dust settling to the disk midplane. What is more, at least 25% of our targets are likely to have disks with radii >10 AU; models with smaller disks cannot reproduce the millimeter fluxes. This result is in contrast to the results of some simulations of the ejection scenario for brown dwarf formation that suggest only ~5% of ejected objects would harbor disks larger than 10 AU. Our findings imply that ejection is probably not the dominant formation process, but may still be relevant for some brown dwarfs.},

@article{Lepine2013,
	abstract = {We present a spectroscopic catalog of the 1564 brightest (J < 9) M dwarf candidates in the northern sky, as selected from the SUPERBLINK proper motion catalog. Observations confirm 1408 of the candidates to be late-K and M dwarfs with spectral subtypes K7-M6. From the low (mu > 40 mas yr-1) proper motion limit and high level of completeness of the SUPERBLINK catalog in that magnitude range, we estimate that our spectroscopic census most likely includes >90% of all existing, northern-sky M dwarfs with apparent magnitude J < 9. Only 682 stars in our sample are listed in the Third Catalog of Nearby Stars (CNS3); most others are relative unknowns and have spectroscopic data presented here for the first time. Spectral subtypes are assigned based on spectral index measurements of CaH and TiO molecular bands; a comparison of spectra from the same stars obtained at different observatories, however, reveals that spectral band index measurements are dependent on spectral resolution, spectrophotometric calibration, and other instrumental factors. As a result, we find that a consistent classification scheme requires that spectral indices be calibrated and corrected for each observatory/instrument used. After systematic corrections and a recalibration of the subtype-index relationships for the CaH2, CaH3, TiO5, and TiO6 spectral indices, we find that we can consistently and reliably classify all our stars to a half-subtype precision. The use of corrected spectral indices further requires us to recalibrate the zeta parameter, a metallicity indicator based on the ratio of TiO and CaH optical bandheads. However, we find that our zeta values are not sensitive enough to diagnose metallicity variations in dwarfs of subtypes M2 and earlier ($\pm$0.5 dex accuracy) and are only marginally useful at later M3-M5 subtypes ($\pm$0.2 dex accuracy). Fits of our spectra to the Phoenix atmospheric model grid are used to estimate effective temperatures. These suggest the existence of a plateau in the M1-M3 subtype range, in agreement with model fits of infrared spectra but at odds with photometric determinations of T eff. Existing geometric parallax measurements are extracted from the literature for 624 stars, and are used to determine spectroscopic and photometric distances for all the other stars. Active dwarfs are identified from measurements of Halpha equivalent widths, and we find a strong correlation between Halpha emission in M dwarfs and detected X-ray emission from ROSAT and/or a large UV excess in the GALEX point source catalog. We combine proper motion data and photometric distances to evaluate the (U, V, W) distribution in velocity space, which is found to correlate tightly with the velocity distribution of G dwarfs in the solar neighborhood. However, active stars show a smaller dispersion in their space velocities, which is consistent with those stars being younger on average. Our catalog will be most useful to guide the selection of the best M dwarf targets for exoplanet searches, in particular those using high-precision radial velocity measurements.},

We find 3897 dwarfs with temperatures below 4000 K, including 64 planet candidate host stars orbited by 95 transiting planet candidates. We refit the transit events in the Kepler light curves for these planet candidates and combine the revised planet/star radius ratios with our improved stellar radii to revise the radii of the planet candidates orbiting the cool target stars. We then compare the number of observed planet candidates to the number of stars around which such planets could have been detected in order to estimate the planet occurrence rate around cool stars. We find that the occurrence rate of 0.5-4 R ⊕ planets with orbital periods shorter than 50 days is 0.90^{+0.04}_{-0.03} planets per star. The occurrence rate of Earth-size (0.5-1.4 R ⊕) planets is constant across the temperature range of our sample at 0.51_{-0.05}^{+0.06} Earth-size planets per star, but the occurrence of 1.4-4 R ⊕ planets decreases significantly at cooler temperatures. Our sample includes two Earth-size planet candidates in the habitable zone, allowing us to estimate that the mean number of Earth-size planets in the habitable zone is 0.15^{+0.13}_{-0.06} planets per cool star. Our 95% confidence lower limit on the occurrence rate of Earth-size planets in the habitable zones of cool stars is 0.04 planets per star. With 95% confidence, the nearest transiting Earth-size planet in the habitable zone of a cool star is within 21 pc. Moreover, the nearest non-transiting planet in the habitable zone is within 5 pc with 95% confidence.},

KOI-256 is listed as hosting a transiting planet-candidate by Borucki et al. and Batalha et al.; here we report that the planet-candidate transit signal is in fact the occultation of a white dwarf as it passes behind the M dwarf. We combine publicly-available long- and short-cadence Kepler light curves with ground-based measurements to robustly determine the system parameters. The occultation events are readily apparent in the Kepler light curve, as is spin-orbit synchronization of the M dwarf, and we detect the transit of the white dwarf in front of the M dwarf halfway between the occultation events. The size of the white dwarf with respect to the Einstein ring during transit (R Ein = 0.00473 $\pm$ 0.00055 R &sun;) causes the transit depth to be shallower than expected from pure geometry due to gravitational lensing. KOI-256 is an old, long-period ePCEB and serves as a benchmark object for studying the evolution of binary star systems as well as white dwarfs themselves, thanks largely to the availability of near-continuous, ultra-precise Kepler photometry.},

@article{Johnson:2012fr,
	abstract = {A rapidly growing body of observational results suggests that planet formation takes place preferentially at high metallicity. In the core accretion model of planet formation this is expected because heavy elements are needed to form the dust grains which settle into the midplane of the protoplanetary disk and coagulate to form the planetesimals from which planetary cores are assembled. As well, there is observational evidence that the lifetimes of circumstellar disks are shorter at lower metallicities, likely due to greater susceptibility to photoevaporation. Here we estimate the minimum metallicity for planet formation, by comparing the timescale for dust grain growth and settling to that for disk photoevaporation. For a wide range of circumstellar disk models and dust grain properties, we find that the critical metallicity above which planets can form is a function of the distance r at which the planet orbits its host star. With the iron abundance relative to that of the Sun [Fe/H] as a proxy for the metallicity, we estimate a lower limit for the critical abundance for planet formation of [Fe/H]crit ~= -1.5 + log (r/1 AU), where an astronomical unit (AU) is the distance between the Earth and the Sun. This prediction is in agreement with the available observational data, and carries implications for the properties of the first planets and for the emergence of life in the early universe. In particular, it implies that the first Earth-like planets likely formed from circumstellar disks with metallicities Z >~ 0.1 Z &sun;. If planets are found to orbit stars with metallicities below the critical metallicity, this may be a strong challenge to the core accretion model.},

	abstract = {The first part of this paper discusses how planet formation proceeds in the disks orbiting M dwarf stars. These environments are different from those associated with solar-type stars in several ways: The planet forming clock (set by orbits) runs slower, the disks are more prone to evaporation, the supply of raw material is lower, the snowline is closer in, and planetary systems are more easily disrupted. Because of these considerations, red dwarfs are less likely to harbor giant planets, but can readily produce smaller planets. The second part of this paper describes stellar evolution calculations for M dwarfs, which live far longer than the current age of the universe. These diminutive stellar objects remain convective over most of their lives, continue to burn hydrogen for trillions of years, and do not experience red giant phases in their old age. Instead, red dwarfs turn into blue dwarfs and finally white dwarfs. This work also shows (in part) why larger stars become red giants.},

Positions and proper motions for 48,330,571 sources (mostly stars) are available on 3 CDs, supplemented with Two Micron All Sky Survey photometry for 99.5% of the sources. The catalog covers the sky area from -90$\,^{\circ}$ to +40$\,^{\circ}$ declination, going up to +52$\,^{\circ}$ in some areas; this completely supersedes the UCAC1 released in 2001. Current epoch positions are obtained from observations with the USNO 8 inch (0.2 m) Twin Astrograph equipped with a 4K CCD camera. The precision of the positions are 15-70 mas, depending on magnitude, with estimated systematic errors of 10 mas or below. Proper motions are derived by using over 140 ground- and space-based catalogs, including Hipparcos/Tycho and the AC2000.2, as well as yet unpublished remeasures of the AGK2 plates and scans from the NPM and SPM plates. Proper-motion errors are about 1-3 mas yr-1 for stars to 12th magnitude, and about 4-7 mas yr-1 for fainter stars to 16th magnitude. The observational data, astrometric reductions, results, and important information for the users of this catalog are presented.},

	abstract = {The Kepler mission is uniquely suited to study the frequencies of extrasolar planets. This goal requires knowledge of the incidence of false positives such as eclipsing binaries in the background of the targets, or physically bound to them, which can mimic the photometric signal of a transiting planet. We perform numerical simulations of the Kepler targets and of physical companions or stars in the background to predict the occurrence of astrophysical false positives detectable by the mission. Using real noise level estimates, we compute the number and characteristics of detectable eclipsing pairs involving main-sequence stars and non-main-sequence stars or planets, and we quantify the fraction of those that would pass the Kepler candidate vetting procedure. By comparing their distribution with that of the Kepler Objects of Interest (KOIs) detected during the first six quarters of operation of the spacecraft, we infer the false positive rate of Kepler and study its dependence on spectral type, candidate planet size, and orbital period. We find that the global false positive rate of Kepler is 9.4%, peaking for giant planets (6-22 R ⊕) at 17.7%, reaching a low of 6.7% for small Neptunes (2-4 R ⊕), and increasing again for Earth-size planets (0.8-1.25 R ⊕) to 12.3%. Most importantly, we also quantify and characterize the distribution and rate of occurrence of planets down to Earth size with no prior assumptions on their frequency, by subtracting from the population of actual Kepler candidates our simulated population of astrophysical false positives. We find that 16.5% $\pm$ 3.6% of main-sequence FGK stars have at least one planet between 0.8 and 1.25 R ⊕ with orbital periods up to 85 days. This result is a significant step toward the determination of eta-earth, the occurrence of Earth-like planets in the habitable zone of their parent stars. There is no significant dependence of the rates of planet occurrence between 0.8 and 4 Earth radii with spectral type. In the process, we also derive a prescription for the signal recovery rate of Kepler that enables a good match to both the KOI size and orbital period distribution, as well as their signal-to-noise distribution.},

	abstract = {The final stage of terrestrial planet formation is known as the giant impact stage, where protoplanets collide with one another to form planets. As this process is stochastic, in order to clarify it, it is necessary to quantify it statistically. We investigate this final assemblage of terrestrial planets from protoplanets using N-body simulations. As initial conditions, we adopt the oligarchic growth model of protoplanets. We systematically change the surface density, surface density profile, and orbital separation of the initial protoplanet system, and the bulk density of protoplanets, while the initial system radial range is fixed at 0.5-1.5 AU. For each initial condition, we perform 20 runs, and from their results we derive the statistical properties of the assembled planets. For the standard disk model, typically two Earth-sized planets form in the terrestrial planet region. We show the dependences of the masses and orbital elements of planets on the initial protoplanet system parameters and give their simple empirical fits. The number of planets slowly decreases as the surface density of the initial protoplanets increases, while the masses of individual planets increase almost linearly. For a steeper surface density profile, large planets tend to form closer to the star. For the parameter ranges that we test, the basic structure of planetary systems depends only slightly on the initial distribution of protoplanets and the bulk density as long as the total mass is fixed.},

To this aim, TASTE (The Asiago Search for Transit timing variations of Exoplanets) project will collect high-precision, short-cadence light curves for a selected sample of transits by using imaging differential photometry at the Asiago 1.82 m telescope. The first light curves show that our project can already provide a competitive timing accuracy, as well as a significant improvement over the orbital parameters.

	abstract = {New transiting planet candidates are identified in 16 months (2009 May-2010 September) of data from the Kepler spacecraft. Nearly 5000 periodic transit-like signals are vetted against astrophysical and instrumental false positives yielding 1108 viable new planet candidates, bringing the total count up to over 2300. Improved vetting metrics are employed, contributing to higher catalog reliability. Most notable is the noise-weighted robust averaging of multi-quarter photo-center offsets derived from difference image analysis that identifies likely background eclipsing binaries. Twenty-two months of photometry are used for the purpose of characterizing each of the candidates. Ephemerides (transit epoch, T 0, and orbital period, P) are tabulated as well as the products of light curve modeling: reduced radius (R P/R sstarf), reduced semimajor axis (d/R sstarf), and impact parameter (b). The largest fractional increases are seen for the smallest planet candidates (201% for candidates smaller than 2 R ⊕ compared to 53% for candidates larger than 2 R ⊕) and those at longer orbital periods (124% for candidates outside of 50 day orbits versus 86% for candidates inside of 50 day orbits). The gains are larger than expected from increasing the observing window from 13 months (Quarters 1-5) to 16 months (Quarters 1-6) even in regions of parameter space where one would have expected the previous catalogs to be complete. Analyses of planet frequencies based on previous catalogs will be affected by such incompleteness. The fraction of all planet candidate host stars with multiple candidates has grown from 17% to 20%, and the paucity of short-period giant planets in multiple systems is still evident. The progression toward smaller planets at longer orbital periods with each new catalog release suggests that Earth-size planets in the habitable zone are forthcoming if, indeed, such planets are abundant.},

	abstract = {Gravitational microlensing occurs when a foreground star happens to pass very close to our line of sight to a more distant background star. The foreground star acts as a lens, splitting the light from the background source star into two images, which are typically unresolved. However, these images of the source are also magnified, by an amount that depends on the angular separation between the lens and source. The relative motion between the lens and source therefore results in a time-variable magnification of the source:  a microlensing event. If the foreground star happens to host a planet with projected separation near the paths of these images, the planet will also act as a lens, further perturbing the images and resulting in a characteristic, short-lived signature of the planet. This chapter provides an introduction to the discovery and characterization of exoplanets with gravitational microlensing. The theoretical foundation of the method is reviewed, focusing in particular on the phenomenology of planetary microlensing perturbations. The strengths and weaknesses of the microlensing technique are discussed, highlighting the fact that it is sensitive to low-mass planetary companions to stars throughout the galactic disk and foreground bulge, and that its sensitivity peaks for planet separations just beyond the snow line. An overview of the practice of microlensing planet searches is given, with a discussion of some of the challenges with detecting and analyzing planetary perturbations. The chapter concludes with a review of the results that have been obtained to date, and a discussion of the near- and long-term prospects for microlensing planet surveys. Ultimately, microlensing is potentially sensitive to multiple-planet systems containing analogs of all the solar system planets except Mercury, as well as to free-floating planets, and will provide a crucial test of planet formation theories by determining the demographics of planets throughout the galaxy.},

Employing weak and strong gravitational lensing to trace and detect the distribution of matter on cosmic and galactic scales, but as well as to the very small scales of exoplanets is a unique meeting point from cosmology to exoplanets. It will use gravity as the tool to explore the full range of masses not accessible by any other means. EUCLID is a 1.2 m telescope with optical and IR wide field imagers and slitless spectroscopy, proposed to ESA Cosmic Vision to probe for dark energy, baryonic acoustic oscillation, galaxy evolution, and an exoplanet hunt via microlensing. A three-month microlensing program will already efficiently probe for planets down to the mass of Mars at the snow line, for free floating terrestrial or gaseous planets and habitable super-Earth. A 12+ month survey would give a census on habitable Earth planets around solar like stars. This is the perfect complement to the statistics that will be provided by the KEPLER satellite, and these missions combined will provide a full census of extrasolar planets from hot, warm, habitable, frozen to free floating.},

	abstract = {We present new Chandra X-ray and Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) radio observations of the nearby merging galaxy cluster A754. Our X-ray data confirm the presence of a shock front by obtaining the first direct measurement of a gas-temperature jump across the X-ray brightness edge previously seen in the imaging data. A754 is only the fourth galaxy cluster with confirmed merger shock fronts, and it has the weakest shock of those, with a Mach number, M = 1.57+0.16 -0.12. In our new GMRT observation at 330 MHz, we find that the previously known centrally located radio halo extends eastward to the position of the shock. The X-ray shock front also coincides with the position of a radio relic previously observed at 74 MHz. The radio spectrum of the post-shock region, using our radio data and the earlier results at 74 MHz and 1.4 GHz, is very steep. We argue that acceleration of electrons at the shock front directly from thermal to ultrarelativistic energies is problematic due to energy arguments, while reacceleration of pre-existing relativistic electrons is more plausible.},

It is the most comprehensive to date, being based on some 4285 standard star spectra obtained on 478 nights spread over a period of 7 years obtained by the Nearby SuperNova Factory using the SuperNova Integral Field Spectrograph. This mean curve and its dispersion can be used as an aid in calibrating spectroscopic or imaging data from Mauna Kea, and in estimating the calibration uncertainty associated with the use of a mean extinction curve. Our method for decomposing the extinction curve into physical components, and the ability to determine the chromatic portion of the extinction even on cloudy nights, is described and verified over the wide range of conditions sampled by our large dataset. We demonstrate good agreement with atmospheric science data obtain at nearby Mauna Loa Observatory, and with previously published measurements of the extinction above Mauna Kea.

	abstract = {We report 25,563 radial velocity measurements for 1359 single-lined stars in the Carney-Latham sample of 1464 stars selected for high proper motion. For 171 of these, we present spectroscopic orbital solutions. We find no obvious difference between the binary characteristics in the halo and the disk populations. The observed frequency is the same, and the period distributions are consistent with the hypothesis that the two sets of binaries were drawn from the same parent population. This suggests that metallicity in general, and radiative opacities in particular, have little influence over the fragmentation process that leads to short-period binaries. All the binaries with periods shorter than 10 days have nearly circular orbits, while the binaries with periods longer than 20 days exhibit a wide range of eccentricities and a median value of 0.37. For the metal-poor high-velocity halo binaries in our sample, the transition from circular to eccentric orbits appears to occur at about 20 days, supporting the conclusion that tidal circularization on the main sequence is important for the oldest binaries in the Galaxy. Some of the results presented here used observations made with the Multiple Mirror Telescope, a joint facility of the Smithsonian Institution and the University of Arizona.},

	abstract = {The Kepler space telescope has opened new vistas in exoplanet discovery space by revealing populations of Earth-sized planets that provide a new context for understanding planet formation. Approximately 70% of all stars in the Galaxy belong to the diminutive M dwarf class, several thousand of which lie within Kepler's field of view, and a large number of these targets show planet transit signals. The Kepler M dwarf sample has a characteristic mass of 0.5 M ☉ representing a stellar population twice as common as Sun-like stars. Kepler-32 is a typical star in this sample that presents us with a rare opportunity: five planets transit this star, giving us an expansive view of its architecture. All five planets of this compact system orbit their host star within a distance one-third the size of Mercury's orbit, with the innermost planet positioned a mere 4.3 stellar radii from the stellar photosphere. New observations limit possible false positive scenarios, allowing us to validate the entire Kepler-32 system making it the richest known system of transiting planets around an M dwarf. Based on considerations of the stellar dust sublimation radius, a minimum mass protoplanetary nebula, and the near period commensurability of three adjacent planets, we propose that the Kepler-32 planets formed at larger orbital radii and migrated inward to their present locations. The volatile content inferred for the Kepler-32 planets and order of magnitude estimates for the disk migration rates suggest that these planets may have formed beyond the snow line and migrated in the presence of a gaseous disk. If true, then this would place an upper limit on their formation time of ~10 Myr. The Kepler-32 planets are representative of the full ensemble of planet candidates orbiting the Kepler M dwarfs for which we calculate an occurrence rate of 1.0 $\pm$ 0.1 planet per star. The formation of the Kepler-32 planets therefore offers a plausible blueprint for the formation of one of the largest known populations of planets in our Galaxy.},

@article{Gonzalez:2001fj,
	abstract = {We propose the concept of a ``Galactic Habitable Zone'' (GHZ). Analogous to the Circumstellar Habitable Zone (CHZ), the GHZ is that region in the Milky Way where an Earth-like planet can retain liquid water on its surface and provide a long-term habitat for animal-like aerobic life. In this paper we examine the dependence of the GHZ on Galactic chemical evolution. The single most important factor is likely the dependence of terrestrial planet mass on the metallicity of its birth cloud. We estimate, very approximately, that a metallicity at least half that of the Sun is required to build a habitable terrestrial planet. The mass of a terrestrial planet has important consequences for interior heat loss, volatile inventory, and loss of atmosphere. A key issue is the production of planets that sustain plate tectonics, a critical recycling process that provides feedback to stabilize atmospheric temperatures on planets with oceans and atmospheres. Due to the more recent decline from the early intense star formation activity in the Milky Way, the concentration in the interstellar medium of the geophysically important radioisotopes 40K, 235,238U, and 232Th has been declining relative to Fe, an abundant element in the Earth. Also likely important are the relative abundances of Si and Mg to Fe, which affects the mass of the core relative to the mantle in a terrestrial planet. All these elements and isotopes vary with time and location in the Milky Way; thus, planetary systems forming in other locations and times in the Milky Way with the same metallicity as the Sun will not necessarily form habitable Earth-like planets. As a result of the radial Galactic metallicity gradient, the outer limit of the GHZ is set primarily by the minimum required metallicity to build large terrestrial planets. Regions of the Milky Way least likely to contain Earth-mass planets are the halo (including globular clusters), the thick disk, and the outer thin disk. The bulge should contain Earth-mass planets, but stars in it have a mix of elements different from the Sun's. The existence of a luminosity-metallicity correlation among galaxies of all types means that many galaxies are too metal-poor to contain Earth-mass planets. Based on the observed luminosity function of nearby galaxies in the visual passband, we estimate that (1) the Milky Way is among the 1.3% most luminous (and hence most metal-rich) galaxies and (2) about 23% of stars in a typical ensemble of galaxies are more metal-rich than the average star in the Milky Way. The GHZ zone concept can be easily extrapolated to the universe as a whole, especially with regard to the changing star formation rate and its effect on metallicity and abundances of the long-lived radioisotopes.},

Despite the low precision of the method for individual stars, we derive [Fe/H] = -2.0 $\pm$ 0.1(internal) $\pm$ 0.5(systematic) for the metal abundance of the VOD from photometric measurements of 0.7 million stars in the northern Galactic hemisphere with heliocentric distances from ~10 kpc to ~20 kpc. The metallicity of the VOD is indistinguishable, within Delta[Fe/H] <= 0.2, from that of field halo stars covering the same distance range. This initial application suggests that the Sloan Digital Sky Survey gri passbands can be used to probe the properties of main-sequence stars beyond ~10 kpc, complementing studies of nearby stars from more metallicity-sensitive color indices that involve the u passband.},

	abstract = {We present a statistical parallax study of nearly 2000 M subdwarfs with photometry and spectroscopy from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Statistical parallax analysis yields the mean absolute magnitudes, mean velocities, and velocity ellipsoids for homogenous samples of stars. We selected homogeneous groups of subdwarfs based on their photometric colors and spectral appearance. We examined the color-magnitude relations of low-mass subdwarfs and quantified their dependence on the newly refined metallicity parameter, zeta. We also developed a photometric metallicity parameter, delta(g - r), based on the g - r and r - z colors of low-mass stars and used it to select stars with similar metallicities. The kinematics of low-mass subdwarfs as a function of color and metallicity were also examined and compared to main-sequence M dwarfs. We find that the SDSS subdwarfs share similar kinematics to the inner halo and thick disk. The color-magnitude relations derived in this analysis will be a powerful tool for identifying and characterizing low-mass metal-poor subdwarfs in future surveys such as Gaia and LSST, making them important and plentiful tracers of the stellar halo.},

	abstract = {We present the results of a stellar membership survey of the nearby open clusters Praesepe and Coma Berenices. We have combined archival survey data from the SDSS, 2MASS, USNOB1.0, and UCAC-2.0 surveys to compile proper motions and photometry for ~5 million sources over 300 deg2. Of these sources, 1010 stars in Praesepe and 98 stars in Coma Ber are identified as candidate members with probability >80% 442 and 61 are identified as high-probability candidates for the first time. We estimate that this survey is >90% complete across a wide range of spectral types (F0-M5 in Praesepe, F5-M6 in Coma Ber). We have also investigated the stellar mass dependence of each cluster's mass and radius in order to quantify the role of mass segregation and tidal stripping in shaping the present-day mass function and spatial distribution of stars. Praesepe shows clear evidence of mass segregation across the full stellar mass range; Coma Ber does not show any clear trend, but low number statistics would mask a trend of the same magnitude as in Praesepe. The mass function for Praesepe (tau ~ 600 Myr; M ~ 500 Modot) follows a power law consistent with that of the field present-day mass function, suggesting that any mass-dependent tidal stripping could have removed only the lowest mass members (<0.15 Modot). Coma Ber, which is younger but much less massive (tau ~ 400 Myr; M ~ 100 Modot), follows a significantly shallower power law. This suggests that some tidal stripping has occurred, but the low-mass stellar population has not been strongly depleted down to the survey completeness limit (~0.12 Modot).},

These spectra were obtained with the new BOSS spectrograph and were taken between 2009 December and 2011 July. In addition, the stellar parameters pipeline, which determines radial velocities, surface temperatures, surface gravities, and metallicities of stars, has been updated and refined with improvements in temperature estimates for stars with T eff < 5000 K and in metallicity estimates for stars with [Fe/H] > -0.5. DR9 includes new stellar parameters for all stars presented in DR8, including stars from SDSS-I and II, as well as those observed as part of the SEGUE-2. The astrometry error introduced in the DR8 imaging catalogs has been corrected in the DR9 data products. The next data release for SDSS-III will be in Summer 2013, which will present the first data from the APOGEE along with another year of data from BOSS, followed by the final SDSS-III data release in 2014 December.},

	abstract = {The ongoing High Accuracy Radial velocity Planet Search (HARPS) has found that 30%-50% of G and K dwarfs in the solar neighborhood host planets with M pl <~ M Nep in orbits of P <= 50 days. At first glance, this high overall occurrence rate seems at best to be marginally consistent with the planet frequency measured during Q0-Q2 of the Kepler mission, whose 1235 detected planetary candidates naively imply that ~15% of main-sequence dwarfs harbor a short-period planet with R pl < 4 R ⊕. A rigorous comparison between the two surveys is difficult, however, as they observe different stellar populations, measure different planetary physical properties, and are subject to radically different sampling plans. In this article, we report the results of a Monte Carlo study which seeks to partially overcome this apparent discrepancy by identifying plausible planetary population distributions which can jointly conform to the results of the two surveys. We find that, given the HARPS occurrence rate, either a population subject to a mass-density relationship extrapolated from our solar system or a population concurrently consisting of dense silicate-iron planets and low-density gaseous worlds can produce total numbers of planet candidates consistent with those actually detected by Kepler. However, these two mass-to-radius relationships (M-Rs) resolve the apparent occurrence rate discrepancy with different mass and period distributions, enabling future observations to rule out M-Rs that do not fully describe the observed planet population in a global sense. Extracting information of this nature from the transit-radial-velocity comparison has significant implications for the interpretation of planet occurrence rates: if a multi-valued M-R, which allows planets of similar mass to have significantly different radii, emerges from observational data, then multiple formation mechanisms are likely at work. In this event, HARPS may be detecting a large population of dense low-mass planets, while Kepler detects a large population of gaseous sub-Neptunes.},

	abstract = {We present a spectroscopic analysis of nearly 8000 late-type dwarfs in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Using the Halpha emission line as an activity indicator, we investigate the fraction of active stars as a function of spectral type and find a peak near type M8, confirming previous results. In contrast to past findings, we find that not all M7-M8 stars are active. We show that this may be a selection effect of the distance distributions of previous samples, since the active stars appear to be concentrated near the Galactic plane. We also examine the activity strength (ratio of the luminosity emitted in Halpha to the bolometric luminosity) for each star and find that the mean activity strength is constant over the range M0-M5 and declines at later types. The decline begins at a slightly earlier spectral type than previously found. We explore the effect that activity has on the broadband photometric colors and find no significant differences between active and inactive stars. We also carry out a search for subdwarfs using spectroscopic metallicity indicators and find 60 subdwarf candidates. Several of these candidates are near the extreme subdwarf boundary. The spectroscopic subdwarf candidates are redder by ~0.2 mag in g-r compared with disk dwarfs at the same r-i color.},

	abstract = {Since the discovery of brown dwarfs in 1994, and the discovery of dust cloud formation in the latest Very Low Mass Stars (VLMs) and Brown Dwarfs (BDs) in 1996, the most important challenge in modeling their atmospheres as become the understanding of cloud formation and advective mixing. For this purpose, we have developed radiation hydrodynamic 2D model atmosphere simulations to study the formation of forsterite dust in presence of advection, condensation, and sedimentation across the M-L-T VLMs to BDs sequence (Teff = 2800 K to 900 K, Freytag et al. 2010). We discovered the formation of gravity waves as a driving mechanism for the formation of clouds in these atmospheres, and derived a rule for the velocity field versus atmospheric depth and Teff, which is relatively insensitive to gravity. This rule has been used in the construction of the new model atmosphere grid, BT-Settl, to determine the micro-turbulence velocity, the diffusion coefficient, and the advective mixing of molecules as a function of depth. This new model grid of atmospheres and synthetic spectra has been computed for 100,000 K > Teff > 400 K, 5.5 > logg > -0.5, and [M/H]= +0.5 to -1.5, and the reference solar abundances of Asplund et al. (2009). We found that the new solar abundances allow an improved (close to perfect) reproduction of the photometric and spectroscopic VLMs properties, and, for the first time, a smooth transition between stellar and substellar regimes -- unlike the transition between the NextGen models from Hauschildt et al. 1999a,b, and the AMES-Dusty models from Allard et al. 2001. In the BDs regime, the BT-Settl models propose an improved explanation for the M-L-T spectral transition. In this paper, we therefore present the new BT-Settl model atmosphere grid, which explains the entire transition from the stellar to planetary mass regimes.},

	abstract = {Knowledge of late K and M dwarf metallicities can be used to guide planet searches and constrain planet formation models. However, the determination of metallicities of late-type stars is difficult because visible wavelength spectra of their cool atmospheres contain many overlapping absorption lines, preventing the measurement of equivalent widths. We present new methods, and improved calibrations of existing methods, to determine metallicities of late K and M dwarfs from moderate resolution (1300 < R < 2000) visible and infrared spectra. We select a sample of 112 wide binary systems that contain a late-type companion to a solar-type primary star. Our sample includes 62 primary stars with previously published metallicities, as well as 50 stars with metallicities determined from our own observations. We use our sample to empirically determine which features in the spectrum of the companion are best correlated with the metallicity of the primary. We find sime120 features in K and M dwarf spectra that are useful for predicting metallicity. We derive metallicity calibrations for different wavelength ranges, and show that it is possible to get metallicities reliable to <0.10 dex using either visible, J-, H-, or K-band spectra. We find that the most accurate metallicities derived from visible spectra requires the use of different calibrations for early-type (K5.5-M2) and late-type (M2-M6) dwarfs. Our calibrations are applicable to dwarfs with metallicities of --1.04 < [Fe/H] <+0.56 and spectral types from K7 to M5. Lastly, we use our sample of wide binaries to test and refine existing calibrations to determine M dwarf metallicities. We find that the zeta parameter, which measures the ratio of TiO can CaH bands, is correlated with [Fe/H] for super-solar metallicities, and zeta does not always correctly identify metal-poor M dwarfs. We also find that existing calibrations in the K and H bands are quite reliable for stars with [Fe/H] >--0.5, but are less useful for more metal-poor stars.},

	abstract = {The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) started a new phase in 2008 August, with new instrumentation and new surveys focused on Galactic structure and chemical evolution, measurements of the baryon oscillation feature in the clustering of galaxies and the quasar Lyalpha forest, and a radial velocity search for planets around ~8000 stars. This paper describes the first data release of SDSS-III (and the eighth counting from the beginning of the SDSS). The release includes five-band imaging of roughly 5200 deg2 in the southern Galactic cap, bringing the total footprint of the SDSS imaging to 14,555 deg2, or over a third of the Celestial Sphere. All the imaging data have been reprocessed with an improved sky-subtraction algorithm and a final, self-consistent photometric recalibration and flat-field determination. This release also includes all data from the second phase of the Sloan Extension for Galactic Understanding and Exploration (SEGUE-2), consisting of spectroscopy of approximately 118,000 stars at both high and low Galactic latitudes. All the more than half a million stellar spectra obtained with the SDSS spectrograph have been reprocessed through an improved stellar parameter pipeline, which has better determination of metallicity for high-metallicity stars.},

	abstract = {We present an IDL graphical user interface-driven software package designed for the analysis of extrasolar planet transit light curves. The Transit Analysis Package (TAP) software uses Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques to fit light curves using the analytic model of Mandel and Agol (2002). The package incorporates a wavelet based likelihood function developed by Carter and Winn (2009) which allows the MCMC to assess parameter uncertainties more robustly than classic chi-squared methods by parameterizing uncorrelated "white" and correlated "red" noise. The software is able to simultaneously analyze multiple transits observed in different conditions (instrument, filter, weather, etc). The graphical interface allows for the simple execution and interpretation of Bayesian MCMC analysis tailored to a user's specific data set and has been thoroughly tested on ground-based and Kepler photometry. AutoKep provides a similar GUI for the preparation of Kepler MAST archive data for analysis by TAP or any other analysis software. This paper describes the software release and provides instructions for its use.},

	abstract = {We present the results of a simple but robust morphological classification of a statistically complete sample of 108 of the most X-ray-luminous clusters at 0.15 <=z<= 0.7 observed with Chandra. Our aims are to (a) identify the most disturbed massive clusters to be used as gravitational lenses for studies of the distant Universe and as probes of particle acceleration mechanisms resulting in non-thermal radio emission; (b) find cluster mergers featuring subcluster trajectories that make them suitable for quantitative analyses of cluster collisions; and (c) constrain the evolution with redshift of the cluster merger fraction. Finally, (d) this paper represents the third public release of clusters from the MAssive Cluster Survey sample, adding 24 clusters to the 46 published previously. To classify clusters by the degree of relaxation, we use the projected offset of the brightest cluster galaxy from the peak (or the global centroid) of the X-ray emission as a measure of the segregation between the intracluster gas and dark matter, and also perform a visual assessment of the optical and X-ray morphology on all scales. Regarding (a), we identify 10 complex systems likely to have undergone multiple merger events in the recent past. Regarding (b), we identify 11 systems likely to be post-collision, binary, head-on mergers (BHOMs), as well as another six mergers that are possible BHOMs but probably harder to interpret because of non-negligible impact parameters and merger axes closer to our line of sight. Regarding (c), we find a highly significant increase with redshift in the fraction of morphologically disturbed clusters (and thus a clear decrease in the number of fully relaxed systems) starting at z˜ 0.4, in spite of a detection bias in our sample against very disturbed systems at high redshift. Since our morphological diagnostics are all based on imaging data and thus sensitive to projection effects, the measured merger fractions should be considered lower limits and our list of mergers incomplete, as we are likely to miss systems forming along axes close to our line of sight. A larger sample of clusters with high-quality X-ray data in particular at high redshift will be needed to trace the evolutionary history of cluster growth and relaxation closer to the primary epoch of cluster formation z˜ 1.},

	abstract = {As part of the long-term radial velocity monitoring of known transiting planets, we have acquired new radial velocity data for the two transiting systems WASP-12 and WASP-14, each harbouring a gas giant on a close orbit (orbital period of 1.09 and 2.24 d, respectively). In both cases, the initial orbital solution suggested a significant orbital eccentricity, 0.049 $\pm$ 0.015 for WASP-12b and 0.091 $\pm$ 0.003 for WASP-14b. Since then, measurements of the occultation of WASP-12 in the infrared have indicated that one projection of the eccentricity (e cos omega) was close to zero, casting doubt on the eccentricity from the initial radial velocity orbit. Our measurements show that the radial velocity data are compatible with a circular orbit. A MCMC analysis taking into account the presence of correlated systematic noise in both the radial velocity and photometric data gives e= 0.017+0.015-0.010. In contrast, we confirm the orbital eccentricity of WASP-14b, and refine its value to e= 0.0877 $\pm$ 0.0030, a 10sigma detection. WASP-14b is thus the closest presently known planet with a confirmed eccentric orbit.

We use these data to evaluate photometric, spectral, and kinematic signatures of youth as 2M0355 is the reddest isolated L dwarf yet classified. We confirm its low-gravity spectral morphology and find a strong resemblance to the sharp triangular shaped H-band spectrum of the ~10 Myr planetary-mass object 2M1207b. We find that 2M0355 is underluminous compared to a normal field L5 dwarf in the optical and Mauna Kea Observatory J, H, and K bands and transitions to being overluminous from 3 to 12 mum, indicating that enhanced photospheric dust shifts flux to longer wavelengths for young, low-gravity objects, creating a red spectral energy distribution. Investigating the near-infrared color-magnitude diagram for brown dwarfs confirms that 2M0355 is redder and underluminous compared to the known brown dwarf population, similar to the peculiarities of directly imaged exoplanets 2M1207b and HR8799bcd. We calculate UVW space velocities and find that the motion of 2M0355 is consistent with young disk objects (<2-3 Gyr) and it shows a high likelihood of membership in the AB Doradus association.},

@article{Gaidos2013,
	abstract = {Statistical analyses of large surveys for transiting planets such as the Kepler mission must account for systematic errors and biases. Transit detection depends not only on the planet's radius and orbital period, but also on host star properties. Thus, a sample of stars with transiting planets may not accurately represent the target population. Moreover, targets are selected using criteria such as a limiting apparent magnitude. These selection effects, combined with uncertainties in stellar radius, lead to biases in the properties of transiting planets and their host stars. We quantify possible biases in the Kepler survey. First, Eddington bias produced by a steep planet radius distribution and uncertainties in stellar radius results in a 15%-20% overestimate of planet occurrence. Second, the magnitude limit of the Kepler target catalog induces Malmquist bias toward large, more luminous stars and underestimation of the radii of about one-third of candidate planets, especially those larger than Neptune. Third, because metal-poor stars are smaller, stars with detected planets will be very slightly (<0.02 dex) more metal-poor than the target average. Fourth, uncertainties in stellar radii produce correlated errors in planet radius and stellar irradiation. A previous finding, that highly irradiated giants are more likely to have "inflated" radii, remains significant, even accounting for this effect. In contrast, transit depth is negatively correlated with stellar metallicity even in the absence of any intrinsic correlation, and a previous claim of a negative correlation between giant planet transit depth and stellar metallicity is probably an artifact.},

ESI saw first light on 1999 August 29. ESI is a multimode instrument that enables the observer to seamlessly switch between three modes during an observation. The three modes of ESI are an R=13,000 echellette mode, a low-dispersion prismatic mode, and a direct-imaging mode. ESI contains a unique flexure compensation system that reduces the small instrument flexure to negligible proportions. Long-exposure images on the sky show FWHM spot diameters of 34 mum (0.34") averaged over the entire field of view. These are the best non-adaptive optics images taken in the visible at Keck Observatory to date. Maximum efficiencies are measured to be 28% for the echellette mode and greater than 41% for low-dispersion prismatic mode including atmospheric, telescope, and detector losses. In this paper, we describe the instrument and its development. We also discuss the performance testing and some observational results.},

@article{Dawson:2012fk,
	abstract = {Exoplanet orbital eccentricities offer valuable clues about the history of planetary systems. Eccentric, Jupiter-sized planets are particularly interesting: they may link the "cold" Jupiters beyond the ice line to close-in hot Jupiters, which are unlikely to have formed in situ. To date, eccentricities of individual transiting planets primarily come from radial-velocity measurements. Kepler has discovered hundreds of transiting Jupiters spanning a range of periods, but the faintness of the host stars precludes radial-velocity follow-up of most. Here, we demonstrate a Bayesian method of measuring an individual planet's eccentricity solely from its transit light curve using prior knowledge of its host star's density. We show that eccentric Jupiters are readily identified by their short ingress/egress/total transit durations---part of the "photoeccentric" light curve signature of a planet's eccentricity---even with long-cadence Kepler photometry and loosely constrained stellar parameters. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo exploration of parameter posteriors naturally marginalizes over the periapse angle and automatically accounts for the transit probability. To demonstrate, we use three published transit light curves of HD 17156 b to measure an eccentricity of e = 0.71+0.16 - 0.09, in good agreement with the discovery value e = 0.67 $\pm$ 0.08 based on 33 radial-velocity measurements. We present two additional tests using Kepler data. In each case, the technique proves to be a viable method of measuring exoplanet eccentricities and their confidence intervals. Finally, we argue that this method is the most efficient, effective means of identifying the extremely eccentric, proto-hot Jupiters predicted by Socrates et al.},

	abstract = {A catalog of common-proper-motion (CPM) companions to stars within 67 pc of the Sun is constructed based on the SUPERBLINK proper-motion survey. It contains 1392 CPM pairs with angular separations 30'' < rho < 1800'', relative proper motion between the two components less than 25 mas yr-1, and magnitudes and colors of the secondaries consistent with those of dwarfs in the (MV , V - J) diagram. In addition, we list 21 candidate white dwarf CPM companions with separations under 300'', about half of which should be physical. We estimate a 0.31 fraction of pairs with red dwarf companions to be physical systems (about 425 objects), while the rest (mostly wide pairs) are chance alignments. For each candidate companion, the probability of a physical association is evaluated. The distribution of projected separations s of the physical pairs between 2 kAU and 64 kAU follows f(s)vprops -1.5, which decreases faster than {\"O}pik's law. We find that solar-mass dwarfs have no less than 4.4% $\pm$ 0.3% companions with separations larger than 2 kAU, or 3.8% $\pm$ 0.3% per decade of orbital separation in the 2-16 kAU range. The distribution of mass ratio of those wide companions is approximately uniform in the 0.1 < q < 1.0 range, although we observe a dip at q ~= 0.5 which, if confirmed, could be evidence of bimodal distribution of companion masses. New physical CPM companions to two exoplanet host stars are discovered.},

	abstract = {We present empirical relations for determining the amount by which the effective temperatures and radii---and therefore the estimated masses---of low-mass stars and brown dwarfs are altered due to chromospheric activity. We base our relations on a large set of low-mass stars in the field with Halpha activity measurements, and on a set of low-mass eclipsing binaries with X-ray activity measurements from which we indirectly infer the Halpha activity. Both samples yield consistent relations linking the amount by which an active object's temperature is suppressed, and its radius inflated, to the strength of its Halpha emission. These relations are found to approximately preserve bolometric luminosity. We apply these relations to the peculiar brown dwarf eclipsing binary 2M0535-05, in which the active, higher-mass brown dwarf has a cooler temperature than its inactive, lower-mass companion. The relations correctly reproduce the observed temperatures and radii of 2M0535-05 after accounting for the Halpha emission; 2M0535-05 would be in precise agreement with theoretical isochrones were it is inactive. The relations that we present are applicable to brown dwarfs and low-mass stars with masses below 0.8 M &sun; and for which the activity, as measured by the fractional Halpha luminosity, is in the range -4.6 <~ log L Halpha/L bol <~ - 3.3. We expect these relations to be most useful for correcting radius and mass estimates of low-mass stars and brown dwarfs over their active lifetimes (few Gyr) and when the ages or distances (and therefore luminosities) are unknown. We also discuss the implications of this work for improved determinations of young cluster initial mass functions.},

@article{Conroy:2012qy,
	abstract = {The spectral absorption lines in early-type galaxies contain a wealth of information regarding the detailed abundance pattern, star formation history, and stellar initial mass function (IMF) of the underlying stellar population. Using our new population synthesis model that accounts for the effect of variable abundance ratios of 11 elements, we analyze very high quality absorption line spectra of 38 early-type galaxies and the nuclear bulge of M31. These data extend to 1 mum and they therefore include the IMF-sensitive spectral features Na I, Ca II, and FeH at 0.82 mum, 0.86 mum, and 0.99 mum, respectively. The models fit the data well, with typical rms residuals <~ 1%. Strong constraints on the IMF and therefore the stellar mass-to-light ratio, (M/L)stars, are derived for individual galaxies. We find that the IMF becomes increasingly bottom-heavy with increasing velocity dispersion and [Mg/Fe]. At the lowest dispersions and [Mg/Fe] values the derived IMF is consistent with the Milky Way (MW) IMF, while at the highest dispersions and [Mg/Fe] values the derived IMF contains more low-mass stars (is more bottom-heavy) than even a Salpeter IMF. Our best-fit (M/L)stars values do not exceed dynamically based M/L values. We also apply our models to stacked spectra of four metal-rich globular clusters in M31 and find an (M/L)stars that implies fewer low-mass stars than a MW IMF, again agreeing with dynamical constraints. We discuss other possible explanations for the observed trends and conclude that variation in the IMF is the simplest and most plausible.},

@article{Ferreras:2012lr,
	abstract = {An essential component of galaxy formation theory is the stellar initial mass function (IMF) that describes the parent distribution of stellar mass in star-forming regions. We present observational evidence in a sample of early-type galaxies (ETGs) of a tight correlation between central velocity dispersion and the strength of several absorption features sensitive to the presence of low-mass stars. Our sample comprises ˜40 000 ETGs from the Spheroids Panchromatic Investigation in Different Environmental Regions survey (z ≲ 0.1). The data - extracted from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey - are combined, rejecting both noisy data, and spectra with contamination from telluric lines, resulting in a set of 18 stacked spectra at high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N ≳ 400 {\AA}-1). A combined analysis of IMF-sensitive line strengths and spectral fitting is performed with the latest state-of-the-art population synthesis models (an extended version of the MILES models). A significant trend is found between IMF slope and velocity dispersion, towards an excess of low-mass stars in the most massive galaxies. Although we emphasize that accurate values of the IMF slope will require a detailed analysis of chemical composition (such as [alpha/Fe] or even individual element abundance ratios), the observed trends suggest that low-mass ETGs are better fitted by a Kroupa-like IMF, whereas massive galaxies require bottom-heavy IMFs, exceeding the Salpeter slope at sigma ≳ 200 km s-1.},

These transformations employ the predictions from Kurucz model atmospheres at high temperatures (Teff>=8000 K) and from MARCS model atmospheres at intermediate temperatures (from 7000 K down to a temperature in the range 4000 K<=Teff<=5500 K, depending on [Fe/H], where adjustments to satisfy observational constraints become necessary). Thus, theoretical color-Teff relations are used exclusively down to a minimum temperature that is cooler than the temperatures of turnoff stars in open and globular star clusters. To better represent the color transformations obeyed by cool stars (down to 3000 K), corrections to the synthetic transformations have been determined from a careful consideration of observations for a few globular clusters (M92, M68, and 47 Tucanae), the color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) of several open clusters (M67, the Pleiades, the Hyades, and NGC 6791), the CMDs and mass-luminosity diagram for solar neighborhood stars having good distance measurements from Hipparcos, empirical (B-V)-Teff and (V-K)-Teff relations, and color-color diagrams for field giants. The semiempirical color transformations that have been produced as a result of our analysis are also compared with several others that have been published in recent years: some of the deficiencies of the latter are revealed.},

	abstract = {We explore how finite integration times or equivalently temporal binning induces morphological distortions to the transit light curve. These distortions, if uncorrected for, lead to the retrieval of erroneous system parameters and may even lead to some planetary candidates being rejected as ostensibly unphysical. We provide analytic expressions for estimating the disturbance to the various light-curve parameters as a function of the integration time. These effects are particularly crucial in light of the long-cadence photometry often used for discovering new exoplanets by, for example, Convection Rotation and Planetary Transits (CoRoT) and the Kepler Missions (8.5 and 30min). One of the dominant effects of long integration times is a systematic underestimation of the light-curve-derived stellar density, which has significant ramifications for transit surveys. We present a discussion of numerical integration techniques to compensate for the effects and produce expressions to quickly estimate the errors of such methods, as a function of integration time and numerical resolution. This allows for an economic choice of resolution before attempting fits of long-cadence light-curves. We provide a comparison of the short- and long-cadence light curves of TrES-2b and show that the retrieved transit parameters are consistent using the techniques discussed here.},

	abstract = {We show that stars with transiting planets for which the stellar obliquity is large are preferentially hot (T eff > 6250 K). This could explain why small obliquities were observed in the earliest measurements, which focused on relatively cool stars drawn from Doppler surveys, as opposed to hotter stars that emerged more recently from transit surveys. The observed trend could be due to differences in planet formation and migration around stars of varying mass. Alternatively, we speculate that hot-Jupiter systems begin with a wide range of obliquities, but the photospheres of cool stars realign with the orbits due to tidal dissipation in their convective zones, while hot stars cannot realign because of their thinner convective zones. This in turn would suggest that hot Jupiters originate from few-body gravitational dynamics and that disk migration plays at most a supporting role.},

	abstract = {We have executed a survey of nearby, main-sequence A-, F-, and G-type stars with the CHARA Array, successfully measuring the angular diameters of forty-four stars with an average precision of ~1.5%. We present new measures of the bolometric flux, which in turn leads to an empirical determination of the effective temperature for the stars observed. In addition, these CHARA-determined temperatures, radii, and luminosities are fit to Yonsei-Yale model isochrones to constrain the masses and ages of the stars. These results are compared to indirect estimates of these quantities obtained by collecting photometry of the stars and applying them to model atmospheres and evolutionary isochrones. We find that for most cases, the models overestimate the effective temperature by ~1.5%-4% when compared to our directly measured values. The overestimated temperatures and underestimated radii in these works appear to cause an additional offset in the star's surface gravity measurements, which consequently yield higher masses and younger ages, in particular for stars with masses greater than ~1.3 M &sun;. Additionally, we compare our measurements to a large sample of eclipsing binary stars, and excellent agreement is seen within both data sets. Finally, we present temperature relations with respect to (B - V) and (V - K) colors as well as spectral type, showing that calibration of effective temperatures with errors ~1% is now possible from interferometric angular diameters of stars.},

@article{Boyajian2012,
	abstract = {We present interferometric angular diameter measurements of 21 low-mass, K- and M-dwarfs made with the CHARA Array. This sample is enhanced by adding a collection of radius measurements published in the literature to form a total data set of 33 K-M-dwarfs with diameters measured to better than 5%. We use these data in combination with the Hipparcos parallax and new measurements of the star's bolometric flux to compute absolute luminosities, linear radii, and effective temperatures for the stars. We develop empirical relations for ~K0 to M4 main-sequence stars that link the stellar temperature, radius, and luminosity to the observed (B - V), (V - R), (V - I), (V - J), (V - H), and (V - K) broadband color index and stellar metallicity [Fe/H]. These relations are valid for metallicities ranging from [Fe/H] = -0.5 to +0.1 dex and are accurate to ~2%, ~5%, and ~4% for temperature, radius, and luminosity, respectively. Our results show that it is necessary to use metallicity-dependent transformations in order to properly convert colors into stellar temperatures, radii, and luminosities. Alternatively, we find no sensitivity to metallicity on relations we construct to the global properties of a star omitting color information, e.g., temperature-radius and temperature-luminosity. Thus, we are able to empirically quantify to what order the star's observed color index is impacted by the stellar iron abundance. In addition to the empirical relations, we also provide a representative look-up table via stellar spectral classifications using this collection of data. Robust examinations of single star temperatures and radii compared to evolutionary model predictions on the luminosity-temperature and luminosity-radius planes reveal that models overestimate the temperatures of stars with surface temperatures <5000 K by ~3%, and underestimate the radii of stars with radii <0.7 R &sun; by ~5%. These conclusions additionally suggest that the models over account for the effects that the stellar metallicity may have on the astrophysical properties of an object. By comparing the interferometrically measured radii for the single star population to those of eclipsing binaries, we find that for a given mass, single and binary star radii are indistinguishable. However, we also find that for a given radius, the literature temperatures for binary stars are systematically lower compared to our interferometrically derived temperatures of single stars by ~200 to 300 K. The nature of this offset is dependent on the validation of binary star temperatures, where bringing all measurements to a uniform and correctly calibrated temperature scale is needed to identify any influence stellar activity may have on the physical properties of a star. Lastly, we present an empirically determined H-R diagram using fundamental properties presented here in combination with those in Boyajian et al. for a total of 74 nearby, main-sequence, A- to M-type stars, and define regions of habitability for the potential existence of sub-stellar mass companions in each system.},

	abstract = {We report the discovery of a wide brown dwarf companion to the mildly metal-poor ([Fe/H] = -0.24), low Galactic latitude (b = 1fdg88) K4V star HIP 38939. The companion was discovered by its common proper motion with the primary and its red optical (Pan-STARRS1) and blue infrared (Two Micron All Sky Survey) colors. It has a projected separation of 1630 AU and a near-infrared spectral type of T4.5. As such it is one of only three known companions to a main-sequence star which have early/mid T spectral types of (the others being HN Peg B and ε Indi B). Using chromospheric activity we estimate an age for the primary of 900$\pm$1900 600 Myr. This value is also in agreement with the age derived from the star's weak ROSAT detection. Comparison with evolutionary models for this age range indicates that HIP 38939B falls in the mass range 38 $\pm$ 20 M Jup with an effective temperature range of 1090 $\pm$ 60 K. Fitting our spectrum with atmospheric models gives a best-fitting temperature of 1100 K. We include our object in an analysis of the population of benchmark T dwarfs and find that while older atmospheric models appeared to overpredict the temperature of the coolest objects compared to evolutionary models, more recent atmospheric models provide better agreement.},

@article{Faherty:2010,
	abstract = {We report on nine wide common proper motion systems containing late-type M, L, or T companions. We confirm six previously reported companions, and identify three new systems. The ages of these systems are determined using diagnostics for both stellar primaries and low-mass secondaries and masses for the secondaries are inferred using evolutionary models. Of our three new discoveries, the M3+T6.5 pair G 204-39 and SDSS J1758+4633 has an age constrained to 0.5-1.5 Gyr making the secondary a potentially useful brown dwarf benchmark. The G5+L4 pair G 200-28 and SDSS J1416+5006 has a projected separation of ~25,000 AU making it one of the widest and lowest binding energy systems known to date. The system containing NLTT 2274 and SDSS J0041+1341 is an older M4+L0 (>4.5 Gyr) pair which shows Halpha activity in the secondary but not the primary making it a useful tracer of age/mass/activity trends. Two of the nine systems have discrepant component ages that emerge from stellar or ultracool diagnostics indicating possible shortcomings in our understanding of the age diagnostics of stars and brown dwarfs. We find a resolved binary frequency for widely separated (>100 AU) low-mass companions (i.e., at least a triple system) which is at least twice the frequency found for the field ultracool dwarf population. The ratio of triples to binaries and quadruples to binaries is also high for this sample: 3:5 and 1:4, respectively, compared to 8 pc sample values of 1:4 and 1:26. The additional components in these wide companion systems indicates a formation mechanism that requires a third or fourth component to maintain gravitational stability or facilitate the exchange of angular momentum. The binding energies for the nine multiples discussed in this text are among the lowest known for wide low-mass systems, suggesting that weakly bound, low-to-intermediate mass (0.2 M sun < M tot< 1.0 M sun) multiples can form and survive to exist in the field (1-8 Gyr).  This paper includes data gathered with the 6.5 meter Magellan Telescopes located at Las Campanas Observatory, Chile.  This paper makes use of data obtained with the telescopes operated by the SMARTS consortium.},

	abstract = {The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) is an imaging and spectroscopic survey that will eventually cover approximately one-quarter of the celestial sphere and collect spectra of ~106 galaxies, 100,000 quasars, 30,000 stars, and 30,000 serendipity targets. In 2001 June, the SDSS released to the general astronomical community its early data release, roughly 462 deg2 of imaging data including almost 14 million detected objects and 54,008 follow-up spectra. The imaging data were collected in drift-scan mode in five bandpasses (u, g, r, i, and z); our 95% completeness limits for stars are 22.0, 22.2, 22.2, 21.3, and 20.5, respectively. The photometric calibration is reproducible to 5%, 3%, 3%, 3%, and 5%, respectively. The spectra are flux- and wavelength-calibrated, with 4096 pixels from 3800 to 9200 {\AA} at R~1800. We present the means by which these data are distributed to the astronomical community, descriptions of the hardware used to obtain the data, the software used for processing the data, the measured quantities for each observed object, and an overview of the properties of this data set.},

	abstract = {We calculate precise stellar radii and surface gravities from the asteroseismic analysis of over 500 solar-type pulsating stars observed by the Kepler space telescope. These physical stellar properties are compared with those given in the Kepler Input Catalog (KIC), determined from ground-based multi-color photometry. For the stars in our sample, we find general agreement but we detect an average overestimation bias of 0.23 dex in the KIC determination of log (g) for stars with log (g)KIC > 4.0 dex, and a resultant underestimation bias of up to 50% in the KIC radii estimates for stars with R KIC < 2 R sun. Part of the difference may arise from selection bias in the asteroseismic sample; nevertheless, this result implies there may be fewer stars characterized in the KIC with R ~ 1 R sun than is suggested by the physical properties in the KIC. Furthermore, if the radius estimates are taken from the KIC for these affected stars and then used to calculate the size of transiting planets, a similar underestimation bias may be applied to the planetary radii.},

	abstract = {We develop a general method to fit the underlying planetary distribution function (PLDF) to exoplanet survey data. This maximum likelihood method accommodates more than one planet per star and any number of planet or target star properties. We apply the method to announced Kepler planet candidates that transit solar-type stars. The Kepler team's estimates of the detection efficiency are used and are shown to agree with theoretical predictions for an ideal transit survey. The PLDF is fit to a joint power law in planet radius, down to 0.5 R ⊕, and orbital period, up to 50 days. The estimated number of planets per star in this sample is ~0.7-1.4, where the range covers systematic uncertainties in the detection efficiency. To analyze trends in the PLDF we consider four planet samples, divided between shorter and longer periods at 7 days and between large and small radii at 3 R ⊕. The size distribution changes appreciably between these four samples, revealing a relative deficit of ~3 R ⊕ planets at the shortest periods. This deficit is suggestive of preferential evaporation and sublimation of Neptune- and Saturn-like planets. If the trend and explanation hold, it would be spectacular observational support of the core accretion and migration hypotheses, and would allow refinement of these theories.},

	abstract = {We present a catalog of revised effective temperatures for stars observed in long-cadence mode in the Kepler Input Catalog (KIC). We use Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) griz filters tied to the fundamental temperature scale. Polynomials for griz color-temperature relations are presented, along with correction terms for surface gravity effects, metallicity, and statistical corrections for binary companions or blending. We compare our temperature scale to the published infrared flux method (IRFM) scale for VTJKs in both open clusters and the Kepler fields. We find good agreement overall, with some deviations between (J - Ks )-based temperatures from the IRFM and both SDSS filter and other diagnostic IRFM color-temperature relationships above 6000 K. For field dwarfs, we find a mean shift toward hotter temperatures relative to the KIC, of order 215 K, in the regime where the IRFM scale is well defined (4000 K to 6500 K). This change is of comparable magnitude in both color systems and in spectroscopy for stars with T eff below 6000 K. Systematic differences between temperature estimators appear for hotter stars, and we define corrections to put the SDSS temperatures on the IRFM scale for them. When the theoretical dependence on gravity is accounted for, we find a similar temperature scale offset between the fundamental and KIC scales for giants. We demonstrate that statistical corrections to color-based temperatures from binaries are significant. Typical errors, mostly from uncertainties in extinction, are of order 100 K. Implications for other applications of the KIC are discussed.},

	abstract = {We present gravitational lens models for 20 strong gravitational lens systems observed as part of the Sloan WFC Edge-on Late-type Lens Survey (SWELLS) project. 15 of the lenses are taken from Paper I, while five are newly discovered systems. The systems are galaxy-galaxy lenses where the foreground deflector has an inclined disc, with a wide range of morphological types, from late-type spiral to lenticular. For each system, we compare the total mass inside the critical curve inferred from gravitational lens modelling to the stellar mass inferred from stellar population synthesis (SPS) models, computing the stellar mass fraction f*≡MSPS/Mlens. We find that, for the lower mass SWELLS systems, adoption of a Salpeter stellar initial mass function (IMF) leads to estimates of f* that exceed 1. This is unphysical and provides strong evidence against the Salpeter IMF being valid for these systems. Taking the lower mass end of the SWELLS sample (sigmaSIE < 230 km s-1), we find that the IMF is lighter (in terms of stellar mass-to-light ratio) than Salpeter with 98 per cent probability, and consistent with the Chabrier IMF and IMFs between the two. This result is consistent with previous studies of spiral galaxies based on independent techniques. In combination with recent studies of massive early-type galaxies that have favoured a heavier Salpeter-like IMF, this result strengthens the evidence against a universal stellar IMF.},

	abstract = {The stellar initial mass function (IMF) describes the mass distribution of stars at the time of their formation and is of fundamental importance for many areas of astrophysics. The IMF is reasonably well constrained in the disk of the Milky Way but we have very little direct information on the form of the IMF in other galaxies and at earlier cosmic epochs. Here we report observations of the NaI doublet and the Wing-Ford molecular FeH band in the spectra of elliptical galaxies. These lines are strong in stars with masses less than 0.3Msolar (where Msolar is the mass of the Sun) and are weak or absent in all other types of stars. We unambiguously detect both signatures, consistent with previous studies that were based on data of lower signal-to-noise ratio. The direct detection of the light of low-mass stars implies that they are very abundant in elliptical galaxies, making up over 80% of the total number of stars and contributing more than 60% of the total stellar mass. We infer that the IMF in massive star-forming galaxies in the early Universe produced many more low-mass stars than the IMF in the Milky Way disk, and was probably slightly steeper than the Salpeter form in the mass range 0.1Msolar to 1Msolar.},

@article{Chabrier:2003fk,
	abstract = {We review recent determinations of the present-day mass function (PDMF) and initial mass function (IMF) in various components of the Galaxy-disk, spheroid, young, and globular clusters-and in conditions characteristic of early star formation. As a general feature, the IMF is found to depend weakly on the environment and to be well described by a power-law form for m>~1 Msolar and a lognormal form below, except possibly for early star formation conditions. The disk IMF for single objects has a characteristic mass around mc~0.08 Msolar and a variance in logarithmic mass sigma~0.7, whereas the IMF for multiple systems has mc~0.2 Msolar and sigma~0.6. The extension of the single MF into the brown dwarf regime is in good agreement with present estimates of L- and T-dwarf densities and yields a disk brown dwarf number density comparable to the stellar one, nBD~n*~0.1 pc-3. The IMF of young clusters is found to be consistent with the disk field IMF, providing the same correction for unresolved binaries, confirming the fact that young star clusters and disk field stars represent the same stellar population. Dynamical effects, yielding depletion of the lowest mass objects, are found to become consequential for ages >~130 Myr. The spheroid IMF relies on much less robust grounds. The large metallicity spread in the local subdwarf photometric sample, in particular, remains puzzling. Recent observations suggest that there is a continuous kinematic shear between the thick-disk population, present in local samples, and the genuine spheroid one. This enables us to derive only an upper limit for the spheroid mass density and IMF. Within all the uncertainties, the latter is found to be similar to the one derived for globular clusters and is well represented also by a lognormal form with a characteristic mass slightly larger than for the disk, mc~0.2-0.3 Msolar, excluding a significant population of brown dwarfs in globular clusters and in the spheroid. The IMF characteristic of early star formation at large redshift remains undetermined, but different observational constraints suggest that it does not extend below ~1 Msolar. These results suggest a characteristic mass for star formation that decreases with time, from conditions prevailing at large redshift to conditions characteristic of the spheroid (or thick disk) to present-day conditions. These conclusions, however, remain speculative, given the large uncertainties in the spheroid and early star IMF determinations.  These IMFs allow a reasonably robust determination of the Galactic present-day and initial stellar and brown dwarf contents. They also have important galactic implications beyond the Milky Way in yielding more accurate mass-to-light ratio determinations. The mass-to-light ratios obtained with the disk and the spheroid IMF yield values 1.8-1.4 times smaller than for a Salpeter IMF, respectively, in agreement with various recent dynamical determinations. This general IMF determination is examined in the context of star formation theory. None of the theories based on a Jeans-type mechanism, where fragmentation is due only to gravity, can fulfill all the observational constraints on star formation and predict a large number of substellar objects. On the other hand, recent numerical simulations of compressible turbulence, in particular in super-Alfv{\'e}nic conditions, seem to reproduce both qualitatively and quantitatively the stellar and substellar IMF and thus provide an appealing theoretical foundation. In this picture, star formation is induced by the dissipation of large-scale turbulence to smaller scales through radiative MHD shocks, producing filamentary structures. These shocks produce local nonequilibrium structures with large density contrasts, which collapse eventually in gravitationally bound objects under the combined influence of turbulence and gravity. The concept of a single Jeans mass is replaced by a distribution of local Jeans masses, representative of the lognormal probability density function of the turbulent gas. Objects below the mean thermal Jeans mass still have a possibility to collapse, although with a decreasing probability.

These new data nearly double the number of L and T dwarfs that have reported L-band spectra. The near-infrared spectra are combined with previously published red-optical spectra to extend the wavelength coverage to ~0.6 mum. Prominent atomic and molecular absorption features are identified including neutral lines of Al, Fe, Mg, Ca, Ti, Na, and K and 19 new weak CH4 absorption features in the H-band spectra of mid- to late-type T dwarfs. In addition, we detect for the first time the 0-0 band of the A 4Pi-X 4Sigma- transition of VO at ~1.06 mum in the spectra of L dwarfs and the P- and R-branches of the nu3 band of CH4 in the spectrum of a T dwarf. The equivalent widths of the refractory atomic features all decrease with increasing spectral type and are absent by a spectral type of ~L0, except for the 1.189 mum Fe I line, which persists to at least ~L3. We compute the bolometric luminosities of the dwarfs in our sample with measured parallaxes and find good agreement with previously published results that use L'-band photometry to account for the flux emitted from 2.5 to 3.6 mum. Finally, 2MASS J2224381-0158521 (L4.5) has an anomalously red spectrum and the strongest Deltanu=+2 CO bands in our sample.

	abstract = {We report the distribution of planets as a function of planet radius, orbital period, and stellar effective temperature for orbital periods less than 50 days around solar-type (GK) stars. These results are based on the 1235 planets (formally "planet candidates") from the Kepler mission that include a nearly complete set of detected planets as small as 2 R ⊕. For each of the 156,000 target stars, we assess the detectability of planets as a function of planet radius, R p, and orbital period, P, using a measure of the detection efficiency for each star. We also correct for the geometric probability of transit, R sstarf/a. We consider first Kepler target stars within the "solar subset" having T eff = 4100-6100 K, log g = 4.0-4.9, and Kepler magnitude Kp < 15 mag, i.e., bright, main-sequence GK stars. We include only those stars having photometric noise low enough to permit detection of planets down to 2 R ⊕. We count planets in small domains of R p and P and divide by the included target stars to calculate planet occurrence in each domain. The resulting occurrence of planets varies by more than three orders of magnitude in the radius-orbital period plane and increases substantially down to the smallest radius (2 R ⊕) and out to the longest orbital period (50 days, ~0.25 AU) in our study. For P < 50 days, the distribution of planet radii is given by a power law, df/dlog R = kRR alpha with kR = 2.9+0.5 -- 0.4, alpha = --1.92 $\pm$ 0.11, and R ≡ R p/R ⊕. This rapid increase in planet occurrence with decreasing planet size agrees with the prediction of core-accretion formation but disagrees with population synthesis models that predict a desert at super-Earth and Neptune sizes for close-in orbits. Planets with orbital periods shorter than 2 days are extremely rare; for R p > 2 R ⊕ we measure an occurrence of less than 0.001 planets per star. For all planets with orbital periods less than 50 days, we measure occurrence of 0.130 $\pm$ 0.008, 0.023 $\pm$ 0.003, and 0.013 $\pm$ 0.002 planets per star for planets with radii 2-4, 4-8, and 8-32 R ⊕, in agreement with Doppler surveys. We fit occurrence as a function of P to a power-law model with an exponential cutoff below a critical period P 0. For smaller planets, P 0 has larger values, suggesting that the "parking distance" for migrating planets moves outward with decreasing planet size. We also measured planet occurrence over a broader stellar T eff range of 3600-7100 K, spanning M0 to F2 dwarfs. Over this range, the occurrence of 2-4 R ⊕ planets in the Kepler field increases with decreasing T eff, with these small planets being seven times more abundant around cool stars (3600-4100 K) than the hottest stars in our sample (6600-7100 K).

	abstract = {Context. The relatively wide spread in the derived metallicities ([Fe/H]) of M dwarfs shows that various approaches have not yet converged to consistency. The presence of strong molecular features and incomplete line lists for the corresponding molecules have made determining the metallicity of M dwarfs difficult. Furthermore, the faint M dwarfs require long exposure times for the signal-to-noise ratio needed for a detailed spectroscopic abundance analysis. Aims: We present a high-resolution (R ~ 50 000) spectroscopic study of a sample of eight single M dwarfs and three wide-binary systems observed in the infrared J band. Methods: The absence of large molecular contributions allows for a precise continuum placement. We derived metallicities based on the best fit of synthetic spectra to the observed spectra. To verify the accuracy of the applied atmospheric models and test our synthetic spectrum approach, three binary systems with a K-dwarf primary and an M-dwarf companion were observed and analysed along with the single M dwarfs. Results: We obtain good agreement between the metallicities derived for the primaries and secondaries of our test binaries, thereby confirming the reliability of our method of analysing M dwarfs. Our metallicities agree well with some earlier determinations, and deviate from others. Conclusions: We conclude that spectroscopic abundance analysis in the J band is a reliable method for establishing the metallicity scale for M dwarfs. We recommend its application to a larger sample covering lower, as well as higher, metallicities. Further prospects for the method include abundance determinations for individual elements.

	abstract = {We develop Bayesian statistical methods for discovering and assigning probabilities to non-random (e.g., physical) stellar companions. These companions are either presently bound or were previously bound. The probabilities depend on similarities in corrected proper motion parallel and perpendicular to the brighter component's motion, parallax, and the local phase-space density of field stars. Control experiments are conducted to understand the behavior of false positives. The technique is applied to the Hipparcos Catalogue within 100 pc. This is the first all-sky survey to locate escaped companions still drifting along with each other. In the <100 pc distance range, ~220 high probability companions with separations between 0.01 and 1 pc are found. The first evidence for a population (~300) of companions separated by 1-8 pc is found. We find these previously unnoticed naked-eye companions (both with V < 6th mag): Capella & 50 Per, delta Vel & HIP 43797, Alioth (epsilon UMa), Megrez (delta UMa) & Alcor, gamma & tau Cen, phi Eri & eta Hor, 62 & 63 Cnc, gamma & tau Per, zeta & delta Hya, beta01, beta02 & beta03 Tuc, N Vel & HIP 47479, HIP 98174 & HIP 97646, and s Eri & HIP 14913. High probability fainter companions (>6th mag) of primaries with V < 4 are found for: Fomalhaut (alpha PsA), gamma UMa, alpha Lib, Alvahet (iota Cephi), delta Ara, beta Ser, iota Peg, beta Pic, kappa Phe, and gamma Tuc.},

@article{Kouwenhoven:2010lr,
	abstract = {Over the past few decades, numerous wide (>103 au) binaries in the Galactic field and halo have been discovered. Their existence cannot be explained by the process of star formation or by dynamical interactions in the field, and their origin has long been a mystery. We explain the origin of these wide binaries by formation during the dissolution phase of young star clusters: an initially unbound pair of stars may form a binary when their distance in phase space is small. Using N-body simulations, we find that the resulting wide binary fraction in the semimajor axis range 103au < a < 0.1pc for individual clusters is 1-30 per cent, depending on the initial conditions. The existence of numerous wide binaries in the field is consistent with observational evidence that most clusters start out with a large degree of substructure. The wide binary fraction decreases strongly with increasing cluster mass, and the semimajor axis of the newly formed binaries is determined by the initial cluster size. The resulting eccentricity distribution is thermal, and the mass ratio distribution is consistent with gravitationally focused random pairing. As a large fraction of the stars forms in primordial binaries, we predict that a large number of the observed `wide binaries' are in fact triple or quadruple systems. By integrating over the initial cluster mass distribution, we predict a binary fraction of a few per cent in the semimajor axis range 103au < a < 0.1pc in the Galactic field, which is smaller than the observed wide binary fraction. However, this discrepancy may be solved when we consider a broad range of cluster morphologies.},

The metallicity variations are employed to assess changes in the H(-) continuum opacity and water-vapor characterizations. The stars are classified in terms of metal-richness with five categories including young disk, old disk, and halo types with attention given to the inverse relationship between metallicity and water-band absorption strength. The results include IR photometric parallax relations for each metallicity group and absolute magnitudes for single stars as well as temperatures, intrinsic colors, and spectral types.

	abstract = {We present the Sloan Low-mass Wide Pairs of Kinematically Equivalent Stars (SLoWPoKES), a catalog of 1342 very-wide (projected separation gsim500 AU), low-mass (at least one mid-K to mid-M dwarf component) common proper motion pairs identified from astrometry, photometry, and proper motions in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. A Monte Carlo-based Galactic model is constructed to assess the probability of chance alignment for each pair; only pairs with a probability of chance alignment <=0.05 are included in the catalog. The overall fidelity of the catalog is expected to be 98.35%. The selection algorithm is purposely exclusive to ensure that the resulting catalog is efficient for follow-up studies of low-mass pairs. The SLoWPoKES catalog is the largest sample of wide, low-mass pairs to date and is intended as an ongoing community resource for detailed study of bona fide systems. Here, we summarize the general characteristics of the SLoWPoKES sample and present preliminary results describing the properties of wide, low-mass pairs. While the majority of the identified pairs are disk dwarfs, there are 70 halo subdwarf (SD) pairs and 21 white dwarf-disk dwarf pairs, as well as four triples. Most SLoWPoKES pairs violate the previously defined empirical limits for maximum angular separation or binding energies. However, they are well within the theoretical limits and should prove very useful in putting firm constraints on the maximum size of binary systems and on different formation scenarios. We find a lower limit to the wide binary frequency (WBF) for the mid-K to mid-M spectral types that constitute our sample to be 1.1%. This frequency decreases as a function of Galactic height, indicating a time evolution of the WBF. In addition, the semi-major axes of the SLoWPoKES systems exhibit a distinctly bimodal distribution, with a break at separations around 0.1 pc that is also manifested in the system binding energy. Compared with theoretical predictions for the disruption of binary systems with time, we conclude that the SLoWPoKES sample comprises two populations of wide binaries: an "old" population of tightly bound systems, and a "young" population of weakly bound systems that will not survive more than a few Gyr. The SLoWPoKES catalog and future ancillary data are publicly available on the Internet for utilization by the astronomy community.},

	abstract = {We report the results from spectroscopic observations of 113 ultra-wide, low-mass binary systems, largely composed of M0-M3 dwarfs, from the SLoWPoKES catalog of common proper motion pairs identified in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Radial velocities of each binary member were used to confirm that they are comoving and, consequently, to further validate the high fidelity of the SLoWPoKES catalog. Ten stars appear to be spectroscopic binaries based on broad or split spectral features, supporting previous findings that wide binaries are likely to be hierarchical systems. We measured the Halpha equivalent width of the stars in our sample and found that components of 81% of the observed pairs have similar Halpha levels. The difference in Halpha equivalent width among components with similar masses was smaller than the range of Halpha variability for individual objects. We confirm that the L{\'e}pine et al. zeta-index traces iso-metallicity loci for most of our sample of M dwarfs. However, we find a small systematic bias in zeta, especially in the early-type M dwarfs. We use our sample to recalibrate the definition of zeta. While representing a small change in the definition, the new zeta is a significantly better predictor of iso-metallicity for the higher-mass M dwarfs.},

	abstract = {We define an enhanced spectral classification scheme for M dwarf stars and use it to derive spectral classification of 104 northern stars with proper motions larger than 0.5" yr-1 that we discovered in a survey of high proper motion stars at low Galactic latitudes. The final tally is as follows: 54 M dwarfs, 25 sdK and sdM subdwarfs, 14 esdK and esdM extreme subdwarfs, and 11 DA and DC white dwarfs. Among the most interesting cases, we find one star to be the coolest subdwarf ever reported (LSR 2036+5059, with spectral type sdM7.5), a new M9.0 dwarf only about 6 pc distant (LSR 1835+3259), and a new M6.5 dwarf only 7 pc from the Sun (LSR 2124+4003). Spectroscopic distances suggests that 27 of the M dwarfs, three of the white dwarfs, and one of the subdwarfs (LSR 2036+5059) are within 25 pc of the Sun, making them excellent candidates for inclusion in the solar neighborhood census. Estimated sky-projected velocities suggest that most of our subdwarfs and extreme subdwarfs have halo kinematics. We find that several white dwarfs and non-metal-poor M dwarfs also have kinematics consistent with the halo, and we briefly discuss their possible origin.},

	abstract = {An extensive sample of M, L, and T dwarfs identified in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) has been compiled. The sample of 718 dwarfs includes 677 new objects (629 M dwarfs and 48 L dwarfs), together with 41 that have been previously published. All new objects and some of the previously published ones have new optical spectra obtained either with the SDSS spectrographs or with the Apache Point Observatory 3.5 m ARC telescope. Spectral types and SDSS colors are available for all objects; approximately 35% also have near-infrared magnitudes measured by 2MASS (Two Micron All Sky Survey) or on the Mauna Kea system. We use this sample to characterize the color-spectral type and color-color relations of late-type dwarfs in the SDSS filters and to derive spectroscopic and photometric parallax relations for use in future studies of the luminosity and mass functions based on SDSS data. We find that the i*-z* and i*-J colors provide good spectral type and absolute magnitude (Mi*) estimates for M and L dwarfs. Our distance estimates for the current sample indicate that SDSS is finding early M dwarfs out to ~1.5 kpc, L dwarfs to ~100 pc, and T dwarfs to ~20 pc. The T dwarf photometric data show large scatter and are therefore less reliable for spectral type and distance estimation. Based on observations obtained with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the Apache Point Observatory 3.5 m telescope, which are owned and operated by the Astrophysical Research Consortium.},

	abstract = {We present 11 years of HIRES precision radial velocities (RVs) of the nearby M3V star Gliese 581, combining our data set of 122 precision RVs with an existing published 4.3-year set of 119 HARPS precision RVs. The velocity set now indicates six companions in Keplerian motion around this star. Differential photometry indicates a likely stellar rotation period of ~94 days and reveals no significant periodic variability at any of the Keplerian periods, supporting planetary orbital motion as the cause of all the RV variations. The combined data set strongly confirms the 5.37-day, 12.9-day, 3.15-day, and 67-day planets previously announced by Bonfils et al., Udry et al., and Mayor et al.. The observations also indicate a fifth planet in the system, GJ 581f, a minimum-mass 7.0 M ⊕ planet orbiting in a 0.758 AU orbit of period 433 days, and a sixth planet, GJ 581g, a minimum-mass 3.1 M ⊕ planet orbiting at 0.146 AU with a period of 36.6 days. The estimated equilibrium temperature of GJ 581g is 228 K, placing it squarely in the middle of the habitable zone of the star and offering a very compelling case for a potentially habitable planet around a very nearby star. That a system harboring a potentially habitable planet has been found this nearby, and this soon in the relatively early history of precision RV surveys, indicates that eta⊕, the fraction of stars with potentially habitable planets, is likely to be substantial. This detection, coupled with statistics of the incompleteness of present-day precision RV surveys for volume-limited samples of stars in the immediate solar neighborhood, suggests that eta⊕ could well be on the order of a few tens of percent. If the local stellar neighborhood is a representative sample of the galaxy as a whole, our Milky Way could be teeming with potentially habitable planets.},

	abstract = {On 2011 February 1 the Kepler mission released data for 156,453 stars observed from the beginning of the science observations on 2009 May 2 through September 16. There are 1235 planetary candidates with transit-like signatures detected in this period. These are associated with 997 host stars. Distributions of the characteristics of the planetary candidates are separated into five class sizes: 68 candidates of approximately Earth-size (R p < 1.25 R ⊕), 288 super-Earth-size (1.25 R ⊕ <= R p < 2 R ⊕), 662 Neptune-size (2 R ⊕ <= R p < 6 R ⊕), 165 Jupiter-size (6 R ⊕ <= R p < 15 R ⊕), and 19 up to twice the size of Jupiter (15 R ⊕ <= R p < 22 R ⊕). In the temperature range appropriate for the habitable zone, 54 candidates are found with sizes ranging from Earth-size to larger than that of Jupiter. Six are less than twice the size of the Earth. Over 74% of the planetary candidates are smaller than Neptune. The observed number versus size distribution of planetary candidates increases to a peak at two to three times the Earth-size and then declines inversely proportional to the area of the candidate. Our current best estimates of the intrinsic frequencies of planetary candidates, after correcting for geometric and sensitivity biases, are 5% for Earth-size candidates, 8% for super-Earth-size candidates, 18% for Neptune-size candidates, 2% for Jupiter-size candidates, and 0.1% for very large candidates; a total of 0.34 candidates per star. Multi-candidate, transiting systems are frequent; 17% of the host stars have multi-candidate systems, and 34% of all the candidates are part of multi-candidate systems.},

	abstract = {Doppler observations from Keck Observatory have revealed a triple-planet system orbiting the nearby K4V star, HIP 57274. The inner planet, HIP 57274b, is a super-Earth with Msin i = 11.6 M ⊕ (0.036 M Jup), an orbital period of 8.135 $\pm$ 0.004 days, and slightly eccentric orbit e = 0.19 $\pm$ 0.1. We calculate a transit probability of 6.5% for the inner planet. The second planet has Msin i = 0.4 M Jup with an orbital period of 32.0 $\pm$ 0.02 days in a nearly circular orbit (e = 0.05 $\pm$ 0.03). The third planet has Msin i = 0.53 M Jup with an orbital period of 432 $\pm$ 8 days (1.18 years) and an eccentricity e = 0.23 $\pm$ 0.03. This discovery adds to the number of super-Earth mass planets with M sin i < 12 M ⊕ that have been detected with Doppler surveys. We find that 56% $\pm$ 18% of super-Earths are members of multi-planet systems. This is certainly a lower limit because of observational detectability limits, yet significantly higher than the fraction of Jupiter mass exoplanets, 20% $\pm$ 8%, that are members of Doppler-detected, multi-planet systems.

	abstract = {We present K-band spectra for 133 nearby (d < 33 ps) M dwarfs, including 18 M dwarfs with reliable metallicity estimates (as inferred from an FGK type companion), 11 M dwarf planet hosts, more than 2/3 of the M dwarfs in the northern 8 pc sample, and several M dwarfs from the LSPM catalog. From these spectra, we measure equivalent widths of the Ca and Na lines, and a spectral index quantifying the absorption due to H2O opacity (the H2O-K2 index). Using empirical spectral type standards and synthetic models, we calibrate the H2O-K2 index as an indicator of an M dwarf's spectral type and effective temperature. We also present a revised relationship that estimates the [Fe/H] and [M/H] metallicities of M dwarfs from their Na I, Ca I, and H2O-K2 measurements. Comparisons to model atmosphere provide a qualitative validation of our approach, but also reveal an overall offset between the atomic line strengths predicted by models as compared to actual observations. Our metallicity estimates also reproduce expected correlations with Galactic space motions and Halpha emission line strengths, and return statistically identical metallicities for M dwarfs within a common multiple system. Finally, we find systematic residuals between our H2O-based spectral types and those derived from optical spectral features with previously known sensitivity to stellar metallicity, such as TiO, and identify the CaH1 index as a promising optical index for diagnosing the metallicities of near-solar M dwarfs.},

@article{Tisserand:2012qy,
	abstract = {Context. R Coronae Borealis stars (RCBs) are hydrogen-deficient and carbon-rich supergiant stars. They are very rare, with only ~50 actually known in our Galaxy. Interestingly, RCBs are strongly suspected of being the evolved merger product of two white dwarfs and could therefore be an important tool for understanding supernovae type Ia in the double degenerate scenario. Constraints on the spatial distribution and the formation rate of such stars are needed to picture their origin and test it in the context of actual population synthesis results. Aims: It is crucial to increase the number of known RCBs significantly. With an absolute magnitude MV ~ -5 and a bright/hot circumstellar shell made of amorphous carbon grains, RCBs are so distinctive that we should nowadays be able to find them everywhere in our Galaxy using publicly available catalogues. In the optical, the search is difficult because RCBs are known to undergo unpredictable photometric declines; however, mono-epoch mid-infrared data can help us to discriminate RCBs among other dust-producing stars. The aim is to produce from the mid-infrared WISE and near-infrared 2MASS catalogues a new catalogue of reasonable size, enriched with RCB stars. Methods: Colour-colour cuts used on all stars detected are the main selection criteria. The selection efficiency was monitored using the 52 known RCBs located in the sky area covered by the WISE first preliminary data release. Results: It has been found that selection cuts in mid-infrared colour-colour diagrams are a very efficient method of distinguishing RCBs from other stars. An RCB enriched catalogue made of only 1602 stars was produced, with a high detection efficiency of about 77%. Spectral energy distributions of 49 known RCBs and 5 known HdCs are also presented with estimates of their photosphere and circumstellar shell temperatures. Conclusions: The newly released WISE all sky catalogue has proven to be a valuable resource in finding RCB stars. Actual scenarios predict that between 100 and 500 RCBs exist in our Galaxy. The newly created RCB enriched catalogue is an important step towards significantly increasing the number of known RCB stars and therefore better understanding their origin.

	abstract = {We report the confirmation and characterization of a transiting gas giant planet orbiting the M dwarf KOI-254 every 2.455239 days, which was originally discovered by the Kepler mission. We use radial velocity measurements, adaptive optics imaging, and near-infrared spectroscopy to confirm the planetary nature of the transit events. KOI-254 b is the first hot Jupiter discovered around an M-type dwarf star. We also present a new model-independent method of using broadband photometry to estimate the mass and metallicity of an M dwarf without relying on a direct distance measurement. Included in this methodology is a new photometric metallicity calibration based on J -- K colors. We use this technique to measure the physical properties of KOI-254 and its planet. We measure a planet mass of MP = 0.505 M Jup, radius RP = 0.96 R Jup, and semimajor axis a = 0.030 AU, based on our measured stellar mass M sstarf = 0.59 M &sun; and radius R sstarf = 0.55 R &sun;. We also find that the host star is metal-rich, which is consistent with the sample of M-type stars known to harbor giant planets. Based on observations obtained at the W. M.

	abstract = {We perform a search for faint, common proper motion companions of Hipparcos stars using the recently published L{\'e}pine-Shara Proper Motion-North catalog of stars with proper motion mu>0.15'' yr-1. Our survey uncovers a total of 521 systems with angular separations 3''<Deltatheta<1500'', with 15 triples and 1 quadruple. Our new list of wide systems with Hipparcos primaries includes 130 systems identified here for the first time, including 44 in which the secondary star has V>15.0. Our census is statistically complete for secondaries with angular separations 20''<Deltatheta<300'' and apparent magnitudes V<19.0. Overall, we find that at least 9.5% of nearby (d<100 pc) Hipparcos stars have distant stellar companions with projected orbital separations s>1000 AU. We observe that the distribution in orbital separations is consistent with {\"O}pik's law, f(s)ds~s-1ds, only up to a separation s~4000 AU, beyond which it follows a more steeply decreasing power law f(s)ds~s-lds with l=1.6+/-0.1. We also find that the luminosity function of the secondaries is significantly different from that of the single stars' field population, showing a relative deficiency in low-luminosity (8<MV<14) objects. The observed trends suggest either a formation mechanism biased against low-mass companions, or a disruption over time of systems with low gravitational binding energy.},

	abstract = {We present a catalog of 1147 candidate common proper motion binaries selected from the revised New Luyten Two-Tenths Catalog (NLTT). Among these, we identify 999 genuine physical pairs using the measured proper-motion difference and the relative positions of each binary's components on a reduced proper motion (RPM) diagram. The RPM positions also serve to classify them as either disk main-sequence pairs (801), halo subdwarf (116) pairs, or pairs containing at least one white dwarf (82). The disk and halo samples are complete to separations of Deltatheta=500'' and Deltatheta=900'', which correspond to ~0.1 and ~1 pc, respectively. At wide separations, both distributions are well described by single power laws dN/dDeltatheta~(Deltatheta)-alpha, with alpha=1.67+/-0.07 for the disk and alpha=1.55+/-0.10 for the halo. The fact that these distributions have similar slopes (and similar normalizations as well) argues for similarity of the star formation conditions of these two populations. The fact that the halo binaries obey a single power law out to ~1 pc permits strong constraints on halo dark matter candidates. At somewhat closer separations (10''<~Deltatheta<~25''), the disk distribution shows a pronounced flattening, which is detected at very high statistical significance and is not due to any obvious systematic effect. We also present a list of 11 previously unknown halo stars with parallaxes that are recognized here as companions of Hipparcos stars.},

	abstract = {This paper reports the results of five years (five runs, 23 nights) of spectropolarimetric observations of active stars with the UCL Echelle Spectrograph of the Anglo-Australian Telescope. A total of 225 circularly (and four linearly) polarized spectra were recorded on 28 objects (21 active stars and seven calibration standards) using the new technique of Zeeman-Doppler imaging. To extract polarization echelle spectra from raw frames, we developed a new dedicated automatic software package (called ESPRIT, which utilizes optimal extraction techniques) whose detailed description is given. For each recorded spectrum, we extract 'mean' polarized and unpolarized profiles using 'least-squares deconvolution', a technique similar to cross-correlation, which can enhance enormously the sensitivity of Zeeman-Doppler imaging, by up to 7.5 mag in flux with respect to a single average line analysis. Magnetic field is detected unambiguously on 14 objects. Marginal field detections are also obtained for the weak-line T Tauri star HD 283572 and the Herbig Ae star HD 104237.},

	abstract = {We present a method for correcting near-infrared medium-resolution spectra for telluric absorption. The method makes use of a spectrum of an A0 V star, observed near in time and close in air mass to the target object, and a high-resolution model of Vega, to construct a telluric correction spectrum that is free of stellar absorption features. The technique was designed specifically to perform telluric corrections on spectra obtained with SpeX, a 0.8-5.5 mum medium-resolution cross-dispersed spectrograph at the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility, and uses the fact that for medium resolutions there exist spectral regions uncontaminated by atmospheric absorption lines. However, it is also applicable (in a somewhat modified form) to spectra obtained with other near-infrared spectrographs. An IDL-based code that carries out the procedures is available for downloading via the World Wide Web.  Based on observations obtained with the Infrared Telescope Facility, which is operated by the University of Hawaii under contract to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.},

The package, called Spextool, carries out all the procedures necessary to produce fully reduced spectra including preparation of calibration frames, processing and extraction of spectra from science frames, wavelength calibration of spectra, and flux calibration of spectra. The package incorporates an ``optimal extraction'' algorithm for point-source data and also generates realistic error arrays associated with the extracted spectra. Because it is fairly quick and easy to use, requiring minimal user interaction, Spextool can be run by observers at the telescope to estimate the signal-to-noise ratio of their data. We describe the procedures incorporated into Spextool and show examples of extracted spectra.},

The design uses prism cross-dispersers and gratings to provide resolving powers up to R~2000 simultaneously across 0.8-2.4, 1.9-4.2, or 2.4-5.5 mum, with a 15" long slit. A high-throughput low-resolution R~200 prism mode is also provided for faint-object and occultation spectroscopy. Single-order 60" long-slit modes with resolving powers up to R~2000 are available for extended objects. The spectrograph employs an Aladdin 3 1024×1024 InSb array and uses narrow slits and a spatial scale of 0.15" pixel-1 for optimum sensitivity on point sources. An autonomous infrared slit viewer is used for object acquisition, infrared guiding, and scientific imaging in the wavelength range 0.8-5.5 mum. The imager employs an Aladdin 2 512×512 InSb array that covers a 60''×60'' field of view at 0.12" pixel-1. SpeX was successfully commissioned on IRTF during 2000 May, June, and July.

	abstract = {Continuing our census of late-type dwarfs in the solar neighborhood, we present BVRI photometry and optical spectroscopy of 800 mid-type M dwarfs drawn from the NLTT proper-motion catalog. The targets are taken both from our own cross-referencing of the NLTT Catalogue and the 2MASS Second Incremental Data Release, and from the revised NLTT compiled recently by Salim & Gould. All are identified as nearby-star candidates based on their location in the (mr,mr-Ks) diagram. Three hundred stars discussed here have previous astrometric, photometric, or spectroscopic observations. We present new BVRI photometry for 101 stars, together with low-resolution spectroscopy of a further 400 dwarfs. In total, we find that 241 stars are within 20 pc of the Sun, while a further 70 lie within 1 sigma of our distance limit. Combining the present results with previous analyses, we have quantitative observations for 1910 of the 1913 candidates in our NLTT nearby-star samples. Eight hundred fifteen of those stars have distance estimates of 20 pc or less, including 312 additions to the local census. With our NLTT follow-up observations essentially complete, we have searched the literature for K and early-type M dwarfs within the sampling volume covered by the 2MASS second release. Comparing the resultant 20 pc census against predicted numbers, derived from the 8 pc luminosity function, shows an overall deficit of ~20% for stellar systems and ~35% for individual stars. Almost all are likely to be fainter than MJ=7, and at least half are probably as yet undiscovered companions of known nearby stars. Our results suggest that there are relatively few missing systems at the lowest luminosities, MJ>8.5. We discuss possible means of identifying the missing stars.},

	abstract = {We have measured the angular diameters of six M dwarfs with the CHARA Array, a long-baseline optical interferometer located at Mount Wilson Observatory. Spectral types range from M1.0 V to M3.0 V and linear radii from 0.38 to 0.69 Rsolar. These results are consistent with the seven other M dwarf radii measurements from optical interferometry and with those for 14 stars in eclipsing binary systems. We compare all directly measured M dwarf radii to model predictions and find that current models underestimate the true stellar radii by up to 15%-20%. The differences are small among the metal-poor stars but become significantly larger with increasing metallicity. This suggests that theoretical models for low-mass stars may be missing some opacity source that alters the computed stellar radii.},

@article{LopezMorales2007,
	abstract = {The recent increase in the number of radius measurements of very low mass stars from eclipsing binaries and interferometry of single stars has raised more questions about what could be causing the discrepancy between the observed radii and those predicted by models. The two main explanations being proposed are a correlation between the radii of the stars and either their activity levels or their metallicities. This paper presents a study of such correlations using all the data published to date. The study also investigates correlations between the radius deviations from the models and the masses of the stars. There is no clear correlation between activity level and radius for the single stars in the sample. These single stars are slow rotators, with typical velocities vrotsini<3.0 km s-1. A clear correlation however exists in the case of the faster rotating members of binaries. This result is based on the X-ray emission levels of the stars. There also appears to be an increase in the deviation of the radii of single stars from the models as a function of metallicity, as previously indicated by Berger et al. The stars in binaries do not seem to follow the same trend. Finally, the Baraffe et al. models reproduce well the radius observations below 0.30-0.35 Msolar, where the stars become fully convective, although this result is preliminary since almost all the sample stars in that mass range are slow rotators and metallicities have not been measured for most of them. The results indicate that stellar activity and metallicity play an important role in determining the radius of very low mass stars, at least above 0.35 Msolar.},

	abstract = {We report the detection of eclipses in LSPM J1112+7626, which we find to be a moderately bright (IC = 12.14 $\pm$ 0.05) very low mass binary system with an orbital period of 41.03236 $\pm$ 0.00002 days, and component masses M 1 = 0.395 $\pm$ 0.002 M ☉ and M 2 = 0.275 $\pm$ 0.001 M ☉ in an eccentric (e = 0.239 $\pm$ 0.002) orbit. A 65 day out-of-eclipse modulation of approximately 2% peak-to-peak amplitude is seen in I-band, which is probably due to rotational modulation of photospheric spots on one of the binary components. This paper presents the discovery and characterization of the object, including radial velocities sufficient to determine both component masses to better than 1% precision, and a photometric solution. We find that the sum of the component radii, which is much better determined than the individual radii, is inflated by 3.8+0.9 -0.5% compared to the theoretical model predictions, depending on the age and metallicity assumed. These results demonstrate that the difficulties in reproducing observed M-dwarf eclipsing binary radii with theoretical models are not confined to systems with very short orbital periods. This object promises to be a fruitful testing ground for the hypothesized link between inflated radii in M-dwarfs and activity.},

The assumption that the companions have the same composition allows us to test the Gizis (1997, AJ, 113, 806) M subdwarf classification system and its correspondence to metallicity. The results are in excellent agreement with the Gizis (1997) scale, thereby showing that the Allard & Hauschildt (1995, \apj, 445, 433) Extended model atmospheres agree well in the 6200 -- 7400 Angstroms region for cool metal-poor stars. We also show that the results are consistent with the main sequences of globular clusters using the Reid (1997, AJ, in press) distance scale. (SECTION: Stars)},

	abstract = {We present two exoplanets detected at Keck Observatory. HD 179079 is a G5 subgiant that hosts a hot Neptune planet with M sin i = 27.5 M ⊕ in a 14.48 days, low-eccentricity orbit. The stellar reflex velocity induced by this planet has a semiamplitude of K = 6.6 m s-1. HD 73534 is a G5 subgiant with a Jupiter-like planet of M sin i = 1.1 M Jup and K = 16 m s-1 in a nearly circular 4.85 yr orbit. Both stars are chromospherically inactive and metal-rich. We discuss a known, classical bias in measuring eccentricities for orbits with velocity semiamplitudes, K, comparable to the radial velocity uncertainties. For exoplanets with periods longer than 10 days, the observed exoplanet eccentricity distribution is nearly flat for large amplitude systems (K > 80 m s-1), but rises linearly toward low eccentricity for lower amplitude systems (K > 20 m s-1).  Based on observations obtained at the Keck Observatory, which is operated by the University of California.},

	abstract = {We present an empirical near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopic method for estimating M dwarf metallicities, based on features in the H band, as well as an implementation of a similar published method in the K band. We obtained R ~ 2000 NIR spectra of a sample of M dwarfs using the NASA IRTF-SpeX spectrograph, including 22 M dwarf metallicity calibration targets that have FGK companions with known metallicities. The H-band and K-band calibrations provide equivalent fits to the metallicities of these binaries, with an accuracy of $\pm$0.12 dex. We derive the first empirically calibrated spectroscopic metallicity estimate for the giant planet-hosting M dwarf GJ 317, confirming its supersolar metallicity. Combining this result with observations of eight other M dwarf planet hosts, we find that M dwarfs with giant planets are preferentially metal-rich compared to those that host less massive planets. Our H-band calibration relies on strongly metallicity-dependent features in the H band, which will be useful in compositional studies using mid- to high-resolution NIR M dwarf spectra, such as those produced by multiplexed surveys like SDSS-III APOGEE. These results will also be immediately useful for ongoing spectroscopic surveys of M dwarfs.},

	abstract = {We present the discovery and mass measurement of the cold, low-mass planet MOA-2009-BLG-266Lb, performed with the gravitational microlensing method. This planet has a mass of mp = 10.4 $\pm$ 1.7 M⊕ and orbits a star of mass M sstarf = 0.56 $\pm$ 0.09 Msun at a semimajor axis of a = 3.2{+1.9\atop -0.5} AU and an orbital period of P = 7.6{+7.7\atop -1.5} yrs. The planet and host star mass measurements are enabled by the measurement of the microlensing parallax effect, which is seen primarily in the light curve distortion due to the orbital motion of the Earth. But the analysis also demonstrates the capability to measure the microlensing parallax with the Deep Impact (or EPOXI) spacecraft in a heliocentric orbit. The planet mass and orbital distance are similar to predictions for the critical core mass needed to accrete a substantial gaseous envelope, and thus may indicate that this planet is a "failed" gas giant. This and future microlensing detections will test planet formation theory predictions regarding the prevalence and masses of such planets.},

@article{Feiden:2011lr,
	abstract = {The recent discovery of an eclipsing hierarchical triple system with two low-mass stars in a close orbit (KOI-126) by Carter et al. appeared to reinforce the evidence that theoretical stellar evolution models are not able to reproduce the observational mass-radius relation for low-mass stars. We present a set of stellar models for the three stars in the KOI-126 system that show excellent agreement with the observed radii. This agreement appears to be due to the equation of state implemented by our code. A significant dispersion in the observed mass-radius relation for fully convective stars is demonstrated; indicative of the influence of physics currently not incorporated in standard stellar evolution models. We also predict apsidal motion constants for the two M dwarf companions. These values should be observationally determined to within 1% by the end of the Kepler mission.},

	abstract = {We constrain the densities of Earth- to Neptune-size planets around very cool (Te = 3660-4660 K) Kepler stars by comparing 1202 Keck/HIRES radial velocity measurements of 150 nearby stars to a model based on Kepler candidate planet radii and a power-law mass-radius relation. Our analysis is based on the presumption that the planet populations around the two sets of stars are the same. The model can reproduce the observed distribution of radial velocity variation over a range of parameter values, but, for the expected level of Doppler systematic error, the highest Kolmogorov-Smirnov probabilities occur for a power-law index alpha ≈ 4, indicating that rocky-metal planets dominate the planet population in this size range. A single population of gas-rich, low-density planets with alpha = 2 is ruled out unless our Doppler errors are >=5 m s--1, i.e., much larger than expected based on observations and stellar chromospheric emission. If small planets are a mix of gamma rocky planets (alpha = 3.85) and 1 -- gamma gas-rich planets (alpha = 2), then gamma > 0.5 unless Doppler errors are >=4 m s--1. Our comparison also suggests that Kepler's detection efficiency relative to ideal calculations is less than unity. One possible source of incompleteness is target stars that are misclassified subgiants or giants, for which the transits of small planets would be impossible to detect. Our results are robust to systematic effects, and plausible errors in the estimated radii of Kepler stars have only moderate impact.  Some data were obtained at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated by the California Institute of Technology, the University of California, and NASA, and made possible by the financial support of the W. M. Keck Foundation.},

	abstract = {We present measurements of the luminosity and mass functions of low-mass stars constructed from a catalog of matched Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) detections. This photometric catalog contains more than 25,000 matched SDSS and 2MASS point sources spanning ~30 deg2 on the sky. We have obtained follow-up spectroscopy, complete to J = 16, of more than 500 low-mass dwarf candidates within a 1 deg2 subsample, and thousands of additional dwarf candidates in the remaining 29 deg2. This spectroscopic sample verifies that the photometric sample is complete, uncontaminated, and unbiased at the 99% level globally, and at the 95% level in each color range. We use this sample to derive the luminosity and mass functions of low-mass stars over nearly a decade in mass (0.7 M sun > M * > 0.1 M sun). The luminosity function of the Galactic disk is statistically consistent with that measured from volume-complete samples in the solar neighborhood. We find that the logarithmically binned mass function is best fit with an Mc = 0.29 log-normal distribution, with a 90% confidence interval of Mc = 0.20-0.50. These 90% confidence intervals correspond to linearly binned mass functions peaking between 0.27 M sun and 0.12 M sun, where the best fit MF turns over at 0.17 M sun. A power-law fit to the entire mass range sampled here, however, returns a best fit of alpha = 1.1 (where the Salpeter slope is alpha = 2.35); a broken power law returns alpha = 2.04 at masses greater than log M = -0.5 (M = 0.32 M sun), and alpha = 0.2 at lower masses. These results agree well with most previous investigations, though differences in the analytic formalisms adopted to describe those mass functions, as well as the range over which the data are fit, can give the false impression of disagreement. Given the richness of modern-day astronomical data sets, we are entering the regime whereby stronger conclusions can be drawn by comparing the actual datapoints measured in different mass functions, rather than the results of analytic analyses that impose structure on the data a priori. Having validated this method to generate a low-mass luminosity function from matched SDSS/2MASS data sets, future studies will extend this technique to the entirety of the SDSS footprint.

	abstract = {We present Keck OSIRIS 1.1-1.8 mum adaptive optics integral field spectroscopy of the planetary-mass companion to GSC 06214-00210, a member of the ~5 Myr Upper Scorpius OB association. We infer a spectral type of L0 $\pm$ 1, and our spectrum exhibits multiple signs of youth. The most notable feature is exceptionally strong Pabeta emission (EW = -11.4 $\pm$ 0.3 {\AA}), which signals the presence of a circumplanetary accretion disk. The luminosity of GSC 06214-00210 b combined with its age yields a model-dependent mass of 14 $\pm$ 2 M Jup, making it the lowest-mass companion to show evidence of a disk. With a projected separation of 320 AU, the formation of GSC 06214-00210 b and other very low mass companions on similarly wide orbits is unclear. One proposed mechanism is formation at close separations followed by planet-planet scattering to much larger orbits. Since that scenario involves a close encounter with another massive body, which is probably destructive to circumplanetary disks, it is unlikely that GSC 06214-00210 b underwent a scattering event in the past. This implies that planet-planet scattering is not solely responsible for the population of gas giants on wide orbits. More generally, the identification of disks around young planetary companions on wide orbits offers a novel method to constrain the formation pathway of these objects, which is otherwise notoriously difficult to do for individual systems. We also refine the spectral type of the primary from M1 to K7 and detect a mild (2sigma) excess at 22 mum using Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer photometry. Some of the data presented herein were obtained at the W.M. Keck Observatory, which is operated as a scientific partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of California and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The Observatory was made possible by the generous financial support of the W.M. Keck Foundation.},

We describe semiautomated observations with the Supernova Integrated Field Spectrograph (SNIFS) on the University of Hawaii 2.2 m telescope on Mauna Kea, with which we achieved photometric precision as good as 5.2×10-4 (0.56 mmag) with a 5 minute cadence over a 2 hr interval. In one experiment, we monitored eight stars, each separated by several degrees, and achieved submillimagnitude precision with a cadence (per star) of ˜17 minutes.

Moreover, the development of a new generation of highly-efficient astronomical instrumentation, equipped with sensitive detectors and working in conjunction with 10-metre ground-based telescopes and the Hubble Telescope in Earth orbit, allowed detailed study of these low temperature dwarfs. This new edition of New Light on DarkStars presents a comprehensive, state-of-the-art review of the considerable progress in research into low-mass stars, brown dwarfs and extrasolar planets over the past few years. The book deals with both the astrophysical nature of individual red dwarfs and brown dwarfs and their collective statistical properties as an important Galactic stellar population.

@article{Morton:2011qy,
	abstract = {We present a framework to conservatively estimate the probability that any particular planet-like transit signal observed by the Kepler mission is in fact a planet, prior to any ground-based follow-up efforts. We use Monte Carlo methods based on stellar population synthesis and Galactic structure models, and report false positive probabilities (FPPs) for every Kepler Object of Interest, assuming a 20% intrinsic occurrence rate of close-in planets in the radius range 0.5 R ⊕ < Rp < 20 R ⊕. Nearly 90% of the 1235 candidates have FPP <10%, and over half have FPP <5%. This probability varies with the magnitude and Galactic latitude of the target star, and with the depth of the transit signal---deeper signals generally have higher FPPs than shallower signals. We establish that a single deep high-resolution image will be an effective follow-up tool for the shallowest (Earth-sized) transits, providing the quickest route toward probabilistically validating the smallest candidates by potentially decreasing the FPP of an Earth-sized transit around a faint star from >10% to <1%. Since Kepler has detected many more planetary signals than can be positively confirmed with ground-based follow-up efforts in the near term, these calculations will be crucial to using the ensemble of Kepler data to determine population characteristics of planetary systems. We also describe how our analysis complements the Kepler team's more detailed BLENDER false positive analysis for planet validation.},

	abstract = {The ever-expanding depth and quality of photometric and spectroscopic observations of stellar populations increase the need for theoretical models in regions of age-composition parameter space that are largely unexplored at present. Stellar evolution models that employ the most advanced physics and cover a wide range of compositions are needed to extract the most information from current observations of both resolved and unresolved stellar populations. The Dartmouth Stellar Evolution Database is a collection of stellar evolution tracks and isochrones that spans a range of [Fe/H] from -2.5 to +0.5, [alpha/Fe] from -0.2 to +0.8 (for [Fe/H]<=0) or +0.2 (for [Fe/H]>0), and initial He mass fractions from Y=0.245 to 0.40. Stellar evolution tracks were computed for masses between 0.1 and 4 Msolar, allowing isochrones to be generated for ages as young as 250 Myr. For the range in masses where the core He flash occurs, separate He-burning tracks were computed starting from the zero age horizontal branch. The tracks and isochrones have been transformed to the observational plane in a variety of photometric systems including standard UBV(RI)C, Stromgren uvby, SDSS ugriz, 2MASS JHKs, and HST ACS/WFC and WFPC2. The Dartmouth Stellar Evolution Database is accessible through a Web site at http://stellar.dartmouth.edu/~models/ where all tracks, isochrones, and additional files can be downloaded.},

	abstract = {We present a variability analysis of the early-release first quarter of data publicly released by the Kepler project. Using the stellar parameters from the Kepler Input Catalog, we have separated the sample into 129,000 dwarfs and 17,000 giants and further sub-divided the luminosity classes into temperature bins corresponding approximately to the spectral classes A, F, G, K, and M. Utilizing the inherent sampling and time baseline of the public data set (30 minute sampling and 33.5 day baseline), we have explored the variability of the stellar sample. The overall variability rate of the dwarfs is 25% for the entire sample, but can reach 100% for the brightest groups of stars in the sample. G dwarfs are found to be the most stable with a dispersion floor of sigma ~ 0.04 mmag. At the precision of Kepler, >95% of the giant stars are variable with a noise floor of ~0.1 mmag, 0.3 mmag, and 10 mmag for the G giants, K giants, and M giants, respectively. The photometric dispersion of the giants is consistent with acoustic variations of the photosphere; the photometrically derived predicted radial velocity distribution for the K giants is in agreement with the measured radial velocity distribution. We have also briefly explored the variability fraction as a function of data set baseline (1-33 days), at the native 30 minute sampling of the public Kepler data. To within the limitations of the data, we find that the overall variability fractions increase as the data set baseline is increased from 1 day to 33 days, in particular for the most variable stars. The lower mass M dwarf, K dwarf, and G dwarf stars increase their variability more significantly than the higher mass F dwarf and A dwarf stars as the time baseline is increased, indicating that the variability of the lower mass stars is mostly characterized by timescales of weeks while the variability of the higher mass stars is mostly characterized by timescales of days. A study of the distribution of the variability as a function of galactic latitude suggests that sources closer to the galactic plane are more variable. This may be the result of sampling differing populations (i.e., ages) as a function of latitude or may be the result of higher background contamination that is inflating the variability fractions at lower latitudes. A comparison of the M dwarf statistics to the variability of 29 known bright M dwarfs indicates that the M dwarfs are primarily variable on timescales of weeks or longer presumably dominated by spots and binarity. On shorter timescales of hours, which are relevant for planetary transit detection, the stars are significantly less variable, with ~80% having 12 hr dispersions of 0.5 mmag or less.},

	abstract = {There is a unique solution of the planet and star parameters from a planet transit light curve with two or more transits if the planet has a circular orbit and the light curve is observed in a bandpass where limb darkening is negligible. The existence of this unique solution is very useful for current planet transit surveys for several reasons. First, there is an analytic solution that allows a quick parameter estimate, in particular of Rp. Second, the stellar density can be uniquely derived from the transit light curve alone. The stellar density can then be used to immediately rule out a giant star (and hence a much larger than planetary companion) and can also be used to put an upper limit on the stellar and planet radius even considering slightly evolved stars. Third, the presence of an additional fully blended star that contaminates an eclipsing system to mimic a planet transit can be largely ruled out from the transit light curve given a spectral type for the central star. Fourth, the period can be estimated from a single-transit light curve and a measured spectral type. All of these applications can be used to select the best planet transit candidates for mass determination by radial velocity follow-up. To use these applications in practice, the photometric precision and time sampling of the light curve must be high (better than 0.005 mag precision and 5 minute time sampling for a two-transit light curve).},

	abstract = {We present ground-based spectroscopic verification of 6 Y dwarfs (see also Cushing et al.), 89 T dwarfs, 8 L dwarfs, and 1 M dwarf identified by the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). Eighty of these are cold brown dwarfs with spectral types >=T6, six of which have been announced earlier by Mainzer et al. and Burgasser et al. We present color-color and color-type diagrams showing the locus of M, L, T, and Y dwarfs in WISE color space. Near-infrared and, in a few cases, optical spectra are presented for these discoveries. Near-infrared classifications as late as early Y are presented and objects with peculiar spectra are discussed. Using these new discoveries, we are also able to extend the optical T dwarf classification scheme from T8 to T9. After deriving an absolute WISE 4.6 mum (W2) magnitude versus spectral type relation, we estimate spectrophotometric distances to our discoveries. We also use available astrometric measurements to provide preliminary trigonometric parallaxes to four of our discoveries, which have types of L9 pec (red), T8, T9, and Y0; all of these lie within 10 pc of the Sun. The Y0 dwarf, WISE 1541-2250, is the closest at 2.8+1.3 -0.6 pc if this 2.8 pc value persists after continued monitoring, WISE 1541-2250 will become the seventh closest stellar system to the Sun. Another 10 objects, with types between T6 and >Y0, have spectrophotometric distance estimates also placing them within 10 pc. The closest of these, the T6 dwarf WISE 1506+7027, is believed to fall at a distance of ~4.9 pc. WISE multi-epoch positions supplemented with positional info primarily from the Spitzer/Infrared Array Camera allow us to calculate proper motions and tangential velocities for roughly one-half of the new discoveries. This work represents the first step by WISE to complete a full-sky, volume-limited census of late-T and Y dwarfs. Using early results from this census, we present preliminary, lower limits to the space density of these objects and discuss constraints on both the functional form of the mass function and the low-mass limit of star formation.},

WISE began surveying the sky on 2010 January 14 and completed its first full coverage of the sky on July 17. The survey will continue to cover the sky a second time until the cryogen is exhausted (anticipated in 2010 November). WISE is achieving 5sigma point source sensitivities better than 0.08, 0.11, 1, and 6 mJy in unconfused regions on the ecliptic in bands centered at wavelengths of 3.4, 4.6, 12, and 22 mum. Sensitivity improves toward the ecliptic poles due to denser coverage and lower zodiacal background. The angular resolution is 6farcs1, 6farcs4, 6farcs5, and 12farcs0 at 3.4, 4.6, 12, and 22 mum, and the astrometric precision for high signal-to-noise sources is better than 0farcs15.},

	abstract = {Between 1997 June and 2001 February the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) collected 25.4 Tbytes of raw imaging data covering 99.998% of the celestial sphere in the near-infrared J (1.25 mum), H (1.65 mum), and Ks (2.16 mum) bandpasses. Observations were conducted from two dedicated 1.3 m diameter telescopes located at Mount Hopkins, Arizona, and Cerro Tololo, Chile. The 7.8 s of integration time accumulated for each point on the sky and strict quality control yielded a 10 sigma point-source detection level of better than 15.8, 15.1, and 14.3 mag at the J, H, and Ks bands, respectively, for virtually the entire sky. Bright source extractions have 1 sigma photometric uncertainty of <0.03 mag and astrometric accuracy of order 100 mas. Calibration offsets between any two points in the sky are <0.02 mag. The 2MASS All-Sky Data Release includes 4.1 million compressed FITS images covering the entire sky, 471 million source extractions in a Point Source Catalog, and 1.6 million objects identified as extended in an Extended Source Catalog.},

	abstract = {We investigate the sensitivity to temperature and gravity of the strong absorption features in the J- and K-band spectra of substellar objects. We compare the spectra of giants and young M dwarfs (of low gravity) to field M and L dwarfs (of high gravity) and to model spectra from the Lyon group. We find that low-resolution spectra of M4-M9 stars and young brown dwarfs at R~350 and signal-to-noise ratios greater than 70 can determine the spectral type to a precision of +/-1 subtype using the H2O and CO bands and can measure the surface gravity to +/-0.5 dex using the atomic lines of K I and Na I. This result points toward the development of photometric spectral indices to separate low-mass members from foreground and background objects in young clusters and associations. We also emphasize the complexity of the interpretation of the empirical quantities (e.g., spectral types) in terms of the physical variables (e.g., temperature, opacities) in the cool atmospheres of young brown dwarfs.

	abstract = {We report the initial results of the Brown Dwarf Spectroscopic Survey Gravity Project to study gravity sensitive features as indicators of youth in brown dwarfs. Low-resolution (R~2000) J-band and optical (R~1000) observations using NIRSPEC and LRIS at the W. M. Keck Observatory reveal transitions of TiO, VO, K I, Na I, Cs I, Rb I, CaH, and FeH. By comparing these features in late-type giants and in old field dwarfs, we show that they are sensitive to the gravity (g=GM/R2) of the object. Using low-gravity spectral signatures as age indicators, we observed and analyzed J-band and optical spectra of two young brown dwarfs, G196-3B (20-300 Myr) and KPNO Tau 4 (1-2 Myr) and two possible low-mass brown dwarfs in the sigma Orionis cluster (3-7 Myr). We report the identification of the phi bands of TiO near 1.24 mum and the A-X band of VO near 1.18 mum together with extremely weak J-band lines of K I in KPNO Tau 4. This is the first detection of TiO and VO in the J band in a substellar-mass object. The optical spectrum of KPNO Tau 4 exhibits weak K I and Na I lines, weak absorption by CaH, and strong VO bands, also signatures of a lower gravity atmosphere. G196-3B shows absorption features in both wavelength regions, like those of KPNO Tau 4, suggesting that its age and mass are at the lower end of published estimates. Whereas sigma Ori 51 appears to be consistent with a young substellar object, sigma Ori 47 shows signatures of high gravity most closely resembling an old L1.5/L0 and cannot be a member of the sigma Orionis cluster.},

	abstract = {We report Nearby Supernova Factory observations of SN 2005gj, the second confirmed case of a ``hybrid'' Type Ia/IIn supernova, which we interpret as the explosion of a white dwarf interacting with a circumstellar medium. Our early-phase photometry of SN 2005gj shows that the interaction is much stronger than for the prototype, SN 2002ic. Our first spectrum shows a hot continuum with broad and narrow Halpha emission. Later spectra, spanning over 4 months from outburst, show clear Type Ia features combined with broad and narrow Hgamma, Hbeta, Halpha, and He I lambdalambda5876, 7065 in emission. At higher resolution, P Cygni profiles are apparent. Surprisingly, we also observe an inverted P Cygni profile for [O III] lambda5007. We find that the light curve and measured velocity of the unshocked circumstellar material imply mass loss as recently as 8 years ago. The early light curve is well described by a flat radial density profile for the circumstellar material. However, our decomposition of the spectra into Type Ia and shock emission components allows for little obscuration of the supernova, suggesting an aspherical or clumpy distribution for the circumstellar material. We suggest that the emission-line velocity profiles arise from electron scattering rather than the kinematics of the shock. This is supported by the inferred high densities and the lack of evidence for evolution in the line widths. Ground- and space-based photometry and Keck spectroscopy of the host galaxy are used to ascertain that the host galaxy has low metallicity (Z/Zsolar<0.3 95% confidence) and that this galaxy is undergoing a significant star formation event that began roughly 200+/-70 Myr ago. We discuss the implications of these observations for progenitor models and cosmology using Type Ia supernovae.},

Recent advances in instrumentation and new missions are extending searches to planets the size of Earth but closer to their host stars. There are several possible ways such planets could form, and future observations will soon test those theories. Many of these planets we discover may be quite unlike Earth in their surface temperature and composition, but their study will nonetheless inform us about the process of planet formation and the frequency of Earth-like planets around other stars.},

	abstract = {Precise near-infrared radial velocimetry enables efficient detection and transit verification of low-mass extrasolar planets orbiting M-dwarf hosts, which are faint for visible-wavelength radial velocity surveys. The TripleSpec Exoplanet Discovery Instrument (TEDI) is the combination of a variable-delay Michelson interferometer and a medium-resolution (R=2700) near-infrared spectrograph on the Palomar 200 inch (5 m) Hale Telescope. We used TEDI to monitor GJ 699, a nearby mid-M dwarf, over 11 nights spread across 3 months. Analysis of 106 independent observations reveals a root-mean-squared precision of less than 37 m s-1 for 5 minutes of integration time. This performance is within a factor of 2 of our expected photon-limited precision. We further decompose the residuals into a 33 m s-1 white noise component and a 15 m s-1 systematic noise component, which we identify as being likely due to contamination by telluric absorption lines. With further development this technique holds promise for broad implementation on medium-resolution near-infrared spectrographs to search for low-mass exoplanets orbiting M dwarfs and to verify low-mass transit candidates.},

	abstract = {Radial velocities measured from near-infrared (NIR) spectra are a potentially powerful tool to search for planets around cool stars and sub-stellar objects. However, no technique currently exists that yields NIR radial velocity precision comparable to that routinely obtained in the visible. We are carrying out an NIR radial velocity planet search program targeting a sample of the lowest-mass M dwarfs using the CRIRES instrument on the Very Large Telescope. In this first paper in a planned series about the project, we describe a method for measuring high-precision relative radial velocities of these stars from K-band spectra. The method makes use of a glass cell filled with ammonia gas to calibrate the spectrograph response similar to the "iodine cell" technique that has been used very successfully in the visible. Stellar spectra are obtained through the ammonia cell and modeled as the product of a Doppler-shifted template spectrum of the object and a spectrum of the cell, convolved with a variable instrumental profile (IP) model. A complicating factor is that a significant number of telluric absorption lines are present in the spectral regions containing useful stellar and ammonia lines. The telluric lines are modeled simultaneously as well using spectrum synthesis with a time-resolved model of the atmosphere over the observatory. The free parameters in the complete model are the wavelength scale of the spectrum, the IP, adjustments to the water and methane abundances in the atmospheric model, telluric spectrum Doppler shift, and stellar Doppler shift. Tests of the method based on the analysis of hundreds of spectra obtained for late-M dwarfs over 6 months demonstrate that precisions of ~ 5 m s-1 are obtainable over long timescales, and precisions of better than 3 m s-1 can be obtained over timescales up to a week. The obtained precision is comparable to the predicted photon-limited errors, but primarily limited over long timescales by the imperfect modeling of the telluric lines.  Based on observations made with ESO Telescopes at the Paranal Observatories under program ID 182.C-0748.},

	abstract = {A decade ago, the detection of the first transiting extrasolar planet provided a direct constraint on its composition and opened the door to spectroscopic investigations of extrasolar planetary atmospheres. Because such characterization studies are feasible only for transiting systems that are both nearby and for which the planet-to-star radius ratio is relatively large, nearby small stars have been surveyed intensively. Doppler studies and microlensing have uncovered a population of planets with minimum masses of 1.9-10 times the Earth's mass (M⊕), called super-Earths. The first constraint on the bulk composition of this novel class of planets was afforded by CoRoT-7b (refs 8, 9), but the distance and size of its star preclude atmospheric studies in the foreseeable future. Here we report observations of the transiting planet GJ1214b, which has a mass of 6.55M⊕ and a radius 2.68 times Earth's radius (R⊕), indicating that it is intermediate in stature between Earth and the ice giants of the Solar System. We find that the planetary mass and radius are consistent with a composition of primarily water enshrouded by a hydrogen-helium envelope that is only 0.05% of the mass of the planet. The atmosphere is probably escaping hydrodynamically, indicating that it has undergone significant evolution during its history. The star is small and only 13parsecs away, so the planetary atmosphere is amenable to study with current observatories.},

	abstract = {Full tests of stellar models below 1Msun have been hindered until now by the scarce number of precise measurements of the stars' most fundamental parameters: their masses and radii. With current observational techniques, the required precision to distinguish between different models (errors < 2-3 %) can only be achieved using detached eclipsing binaries where 1) both stars are similar in mass, i.e. q = M1/M2 ˜ 1.0, and 2) each star is a main sequence object below 1Msun.  Until 2003 only three such binaries had been found and analyzed in detail. Two new systems were published in 2005 (Creevey et al.; L{\'o}pez-Morales & Ribas), almost doubling the previous number of data points. Here we present preliminary results for 3 new low-mass detached eclipsing binaries. These are the first studied systems from our sample of 41 new binaries (Shaw & L{\'o}pez-Morales, this proceedings). We also provide an updated comparison between the Mass-Radius and the Mass-Teff relations predicted by the models and the observational data from detached eclipsing binaries.},

	abstract = {We have recently carried out spectral synthesis modeling to determine Teff, logg, vsini, and [Fe/H] for 1040 FGK-type stars on the Keck, Lick, and Anglo-Australian Telescope planet search programs. This is the first time that a single, uniform spectroscopic analysis has been made for every star on a large Doppler planet search survey. We identify a subset of 850 stars that have Doppler observations sufficient to detect uniformly all planets with radial velocity semiamplitudes K>30 m s-1 and orbital periods shorter than 4 yr. From this subset of stars, we determine that fewer than 3% of stars with -0.5<[Fe/H]<0.0 have Doppler-detected planets. Above solar metallicity, there is a smooth and rapid rise in the fraction of stars with planets. At [Fe/H]>+0.3 dex, 25% of observed stars have detected gas giant planets. A power-law fit to these data relates the formation probability for gas giant planets to the square of the number of metal atoms. High stellar metallicity also appears to be correlated with the presence of multiple-planet systems and with the total detected planet mass. This data set was examined to better understand the origin of high metallicity in stars with planets. None of the expected fossil signatures of accretion are observed in stars with planets relative to the general sample: (1) metallicity does not appear to increase as the mass of the convective envelopes decreases, (2) subgiants with planets do not show dilution of metallicity, (3) no abundance variations for Na, Si, Ti, or Ni are found as a function of condensation temperature, and (4) no correlations between metallicity and orbital period or eccentricity could be identified. We conclude that stars with extrasolar planets do not have an accretion signature that distinguishes them from other stars; more likely, they are simply born in higher metallicity molecular clouds.  Based on observations obtained at Lick and Keck Observatories, operated by the University of California, and the Anglo-Australian Observatories.},

	abstract = {Kepler seeks to detect sequences of transits of Earth-size exoplanets orbiting solar-like stars. Such transit signals are on the order of 100 ppm. The high photometric precision demanded by Kepler requires detailed knowledge of how the Kepler pixels respond to starlight during a nominal observation. This information is provided by the Kepler pixel response function (PRF), defined as the composite of Kepler's optical point-spread function, integrated spacecraft pointing jitter during a nominal cadence and other systematic effects. To provide sub-pixel resolution, the PRF is represented as a piecewise-continuous polynomial on a sub-pixel mesh. This continuous representation allows the prediction of a star's flux value on any pixel given the star's pixel position. The advantages and difficulties of this polynomial representation are discussed, including characterization of spatial variation in the PRF and the smoothing of discontinuities between sub-pixel polynomial patches. On-orbit super-resolution measurements of the PRF across the Kepler field of view are described. Two uses of the PRF are presented: the selection of pixels for each star that maximizes the photometric signal-to-noise ratio for that star, and PRF-fitted centroids which provide robust and accurate stellar positions on the CCD, primarily used for attitude and plate scale tracking. Good knowledge of the PRF has been a critical component for the successful collection of high-precision photometry by Kepler.},

	abstract = {The Kepler Mission relies on precise differential photometry to detect the 80 parts per million (ppm) signal from an Earth-Sun equivalent transit. Such precision requires superb instrument stability on timescales up to ~2 days and systematic error removal to better than 20 ppm. To this end, the spacecraft and photometer underwent 67 days of commissioning, which included several data sets taken to characterize the photometer performance. Because Kepler has no shutter, we took a series of dark images prior to the dust cover ejection, from which we measured the bias levels, dark current, and read noise. These basic detector properties are essentially unchanged from ground-based tests, indicating that the photometer is working as expected. Several image artifacts have proven more complex than when observed during ground testing, as a result of their interactions with starlight and the greater thermal stability in flight, which causes the temperature-dependent artifact variations to be on the timescales of transits. Because of Kepler's unprecedented sensitivity and stability, we have also seen several unexpected systematics that affect photometric precision. We are using the first 43 days of science data to characterize these effects and to develop detection and mitigation methods that will be implemented in the calibration pipeline. Based on early testing, we expect to attain Kepler's planned photometric precision over 80%-90% of the field of view.},

	abstract = {The Kepler Mission seeks to detect Earth-size planets transiting solar-like stars in its ~115 deg2 field of view over the course of its 3.5 year primary mission by monitoring the brightness of each of ~156,000 Long Cadence stellar targets with a time resolution of 29.4 minutes. We discuss the photometric precision achieved on timescales relevant to transit detection for data obtained in the 33.5 day long Quarter 1 (Q1) observations that ended 2009 June 15. The lower envelope of the photometric precision obtained at various timescales is consistent with expected random noise sources, indicating that Kepler has the capability to fulfill its mission. The Kepler light curves exhibit high precision over a large dynamic range, which will surely permit their use for a large variety of investigations in addition to finding and characterizing planets. We discuss the temporal characteristics of both the raw flux time series and the systematic error-corrected flux time series produced by the Kepler Science Pipeline, and give examples illustrating Kepler's large dynamic range and the variety of light curves obtained from the Q1 observations.},

	abstract = {The Kepler Mission, launched on 2009 March 6, was designed with the explicit capability to detect Earth-size planets in the habitable zone of solar-like stars using the transit photometry method. Results from just 43 days of data along with ground-based follow-up observations have identified five new transiting planets with measurements of their masses, radii, and orbital periods. Many aspects of stellar astrophysics also benefit from the unique, precise, extended, and nearly continuous data set for a large number and variety of stars. Early results for classical variables and eclipsing stars show great promise. To fully understand the methodology, processes, and eventually the results from the mission, we present the underlying rationale that ultimately led to the flight and ground system designs used to achieve the exquisite photometric performance. As an example of the initial photometric results, we present variability measurements that can be used to distinguish dwarf stars from red giants.},

The habitable zone is the region where planetary temperatures are suitable for water to exist on a planet's surface. During the first 6 weeks of observations, Kepler monitored 156,000 stars, and five new exoplanets with sizes between 0.37 and 1.6 Jupiter radii and orbital periods from 3.2 to 4.9 days were discovered. The density of the Neptune-sized Kepler-4b is similar to that of Neptune and GJ 436b, even though the irradiation level is 800,000 times higher. Kepler-7b is one of the lowest-density planets (~0.17 gram per cubic centimeter) yet detected. Kepler-5b, -6b, and -8b confirm the existence of planets with densities lower than those predicted for gas giant planets.},

	abstract = {The solar chemical composition is an important ingredient in our understanding of the formation, structure, and evolution of both the Sun and our Solar System. Furthermore, it is an essential reference standard against which the elemental contents of other astronomical objects are compared. In this review, we evaluate the current understanding of the solar photospheric composition. In particular, we present a redetermination of the abundances of nearly all available elements, using a realistic new three-dimensional (3D), time-dependent hydrodynamical model of the solar atmosphere. We have carefully considered the atomic input data and selection of spectral lines, and accounted for departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) whenever possible. The end result is a comprehensive and homogeneous compilation of the solar elemental abundances. Particularly noteworthy findings are significantly lower abundances of C, N, O, and Ne compared to the widely used values of a decade ago. The new solar chemical composition is supported by a high degree of internal consistency between available abundance indicators, and by agreement with values obtained in the Solar Neighborhood and from the most pristine meteorites. There is, however, a stark conflict with standard models of the solar interior according to helioseismology, a discrepancy that has yet to find a satisfactory resolution.},

The spectral coverage is from 3800 to 10000 {\AA} with a nominal resolving power of 12,000. These spectra include many of the spectral lines most widely used as optical and near-infrared indicators of chromospheric activity such as the Balmer lines (Halpha to Hepsilon), Ca II H & K, the Mg I b triplet, Na I D_1, D_2, He I D_3, and Ca II IRT lines. There are also a large number of photospheric lines, which can also be affected by chromospheric activity, and temperature-sensitive photospheric features such as TiO bands. The spectra have been compiled with the goal of providing a set of standards observed at medium resolution. We have extensively used such data for the study of active chromosphere stars by applying a spectral subtraction technique. However, the data set presented here can also be utilized in a wide variety of ways ranging from radial velocity templates to study of variable stars and stellar population synthesis. This library can also be used for spectral classification purposes and determination of atmospheric parameters (T_eff, logg, [Fe/H]). A digital version of all the fully reduced spectra is available via ftp and the World Wide Web (WWW) in FITS format.},

	abstract = {Context: A new reduction of the astrometric data as produced by the Hipparcos mission has been published, claiming accuracies for nearly all stars brighter than magnitude Hp=8 to be better, by up to a factor 4, than in the original catalogue.  Aims: The new Hipparcos astrometric catalogue is checked for the quality of the data and the consistency of the formal errors as well as the possible presence of error correlations. The differences with the earlier publication are explained.  Methods: The internal errors are followed through the reduction process, and the external errors are investigated on the basis of a comparison with radio observations of a small selection of stars, and the distribution of negative parallaxes. Error correlation levels are investigated and the reduction by more than a factor 10 as obtained in the new catalogue is explained.  Results: The formal errors on the parallaxes for the new catalogue are confirmed. The presence of a small amount of additional noise, though unlikely, cannot be ruled out. Conclusions: The new reduction of the Hipparcos astrometric data provides an improvement by a factor 2.2 in the total weight compared to the catalogue published in 1997, and provides much improved data for a wide range of studies on stellar luminosities and local galactic kinematics.},

@article{van-Leeuwen2005,
	abstract = {We present an outline of a new reduction of the Hipparcos astrometric data, the justifications of which are described in the accompanying paper. The emphasis is on those aspects of the data analysis that are fundamentally different from the ones used for the catalogue published in 1997. The new reduction uses a dynamical modelling of the satellite's attitude. It incorporates provisions for scan-phase discontinuities and hits, most of which have now been identified. Solutions for the final along-scan attitude (the reconstruction of the satellite's scan phase), the abscissa corrections and the instrument model, originally solved simultaneously in the great-circle solution, are now de-coupled. This is made possible by starting the solution iterations with the astrometric data from the published catalogue. The de-coupling removes instabilities that affected great-circle solutions for short data sets in the published data. The modelling-noise reduction implies smaller systematic errors, which is reflected in a reduction of the abscissa-error correlations by about a factor 40. Special care is taken to ensure that measurements from both fields of view contribute significantly to the along-scan attitude solution. This improves the overall connectivity of the data and rigidity of the reconstructed sky, which is of critical importance to the reliability of the astrometric data. The changes in the reduction process and the improved understanding of the dynamics of the satellite result in considerable formal-error reductions for stars brighter than 8th magnitude.},

For each spectrum, we provide measurements of the spectral type, a number of molecular band heads, and the Halpha, Hbeta, Hgamma, Hdelta, and Ca II K emission lines. In addition, we calculate the metallicity-sensitive parameter zeta and identify a relationship between zeta and the g - r and r - z colors of M dwarfs. We assess the precision of our spectral types (which were assigned by individual examination), review the bulk attributes of the sample, and examine the magnetic activity properties of M dwarfs, in particular those traced by the higher order Balmer transitions. Our catalog is cross-matched to Two Micron All Sky Survey infrared data, and contains photometric distances for each star. Finally, we identify eight new late-type M dwarfs that are possibly within 25 pc of the Sun. Future studies will use these data to thoroughly examine magnetic activity and kinematics in late-type M dwarfs and examine the chemical and dynamical history of the local Milky Way.},

	abstract = {We describe an astrometric and spectroscopic campaign to confirm the youth and association of a complete sample of candidate wide companions in Taurus and Upper Sco. Our survey found 15 new binary systems (three in Taurus and 12 in Upper Sco) with separations of 3''-30'' (500-5000 AU) among all of the known members with masses of 2.5-0.012 M sun. The total sample of 49 wide systems in these two regions conforms to only some expectations from field multiplicity surveys. Higher mass stars have a higher frequency of wide binary companions, and there is a marked paucity of wide binary systems near the substellar regime. However, the separation distribution appears to be log-flat, rather than declining as in the field, and the mass ratio distribution is more biased toward similar-mass companions than the initial mass function or the field G-dwarf distribution. The maximum separation also shows no evidence of a limit at lsim5000 AU until the abrupt cessation of any wide binary formation at system masses of ~0.3 M sun. We attribute this result to the post-natal dynamical sculpting that occurs for most field systems; our binary systems will escape to the field intact, but most field stars are formed in denser clusters and undergo significant dynamical evolution. In summary, only wide binary systems with total masses lsim0.3 M sun appear to be "unusually wide."},

We propose a modified definition of the Na I index by defining a red continuum at 8234 A and by measuring the equivalent width in the range 8172--8197 A, avoiding the region at lambda > 8197 A, which contains V I, Zr I, Fe I, and TiO lines.},

We have measured Fe and Ti abundances in 35 M and K dwarf stars using equivalent widths measured from lambda/Deltalambda~ 33000 spectra. Our analysis takes advantage of recent improvements in model atmospheres of low-temperature dwarf stars. The stars have temperatures between 3300 and 4700 K, with most cooler than 4100 K. They cover an iron abundance range of -2.44 < [Fe/H] < +0.16. Our measurements show [Ti/Fe] decreasing with increasing [Fe/H], a trend similar to that measured for warmer stars, where abundance analysis techniques have been tested more thoroughly. This study is a step towards the observational calibration of procedures to estimate the metallicity of low-mass dwarf stars using photometric and low-resolution spectral indices.},

The molecular band index to metallicity relation can be calibrated using chemical abundances calculated from atomic-line equivalent width measurements in high-resolution spectra. Building on previous work, we have measured Fe and Ti abundances in 32 additional M and K dwarf stars to extend the range of temperature and metallicity covered. A test of our analysis method using warm star-cool star binaries shows we can calculate reliable abundances for stars warmer than 3500 K. We have used abundance measurements for warmer binary or cluster companions to estimate abundances in six additional cool dwarfs. Adding stars measured in our previous work and others from the literature provides 76 stars with Fe abundance and CaH2 and TiO5 index measurements. The CaH2 molecular index is directly correlated with temperature. TiO5 depends on temperature and metallicity. Metallicity can be estimated to within +/-0.3 dex within the bounds of our calibration, which extends from roughly [Fe/H]=+0.05 to -1.0, with a limited extension to -1.5.},

	abstract = {The current classification system of M stars on the main sequence distinguishes three metallicity classes (dwarfs: dM; subdwarfs: sdM; and extreme subdwarfs: esdM). The spectroscopic definition of these classes is based on the relative strength of prominent CaH and TiO molecular absorption bands near 7000 {\AA}, as quantified by three spectroscopic indices (CaH2, CaH3, and TiO5). The boundaries between the metallicity classes were initially defined from a relatively small sample of only 79 metal-poor stars (subdwarfs and extreme subdwarfs). We re-examine this classification system in light of our ongoing spectroscopic survey of stars with proper motion mu>0.45'' yr-1, which has increased the census of spectroscopically identified metal-poor M stars to over 400 objects. Kinematic separation of disk dwarfs and halo subdwarfs suggest deficiencies in the current classification system. Observations of common proper motion doubles indicates that the current dM/sdM and sdM/esdM boundaries in the [TiO5, CaH2+CaH3] index plane do not follow isometallicity contours, leaving some binaries inappropriately classified as dM+sdM or sdM+esdM. We propose a revision of the classification system based on an empirical calibration of the TiO/CaH ratio for stars of near solar metallicity. We introduce the parameter zetaTiO/CaH, which quantifies the weakening of the TiO band strength due to metallicity effect, with values ranging from zetaTiO/CaH=1 for stars of near-solar metallicity to zetaTiO/CaH~=0 for the most metal-poor (and TiO depleted) subdwarfs. We redefine the metallicity classes based on the value of the parameter zetaTiO/CaH and refine the scheme by introducing an additional class of ultrasubdwarfs (usdM). We introduce sequences of sdM, esdM, and usdM stars to be used as formal classification standards.

	abstract = {The Third Catalogue of Nearby Stars (Gliese & Jahreiss Preliminary Version of the third Catalogue of Nearby Stars, 1991) includes over 1850 stars which lie north of delta 30$\,^{\circ}$ and are either identified as spectral type M, or are unclassified but with an absolute visual magnitude estimate MV>+8.O. Although there is no uniformity in selection criteria, and many of the stars lack basic data (radial velocities, spectral types, accurate photometry), the observational properties of these stars underlie most estimates of the fundamental characteristics of the Galactic Disk. We have obtained optical spectroscopy of 1746 of the 1876 stars-the remaining 130 are binary companions of brighter stars and inaccessible to our observations. These spectra allow us, first, to exclude 61 stars as either degenerates or as misclassified earlier-type (B - K) stars lying beyond the 25 pc limit; to establish radial velocities accurate to $\pm$10 km s-1 for all stars confirmed as late-type dwarfs; to determine spectral types and absolute magnitudes from the TiO bandstrength, allowing more accurate distance estimates for stars with inaccurate (or no) trigonometric parallax measurements; and to identify stars with Ha emission (chromospherically active stars) and with strong CaH absorption (perhaps including some metal-poor disk subdwarfs). We have determined the nearby-star luminosity function from complete samples derived by applying both the distance limits defined by Wielen (1974) and by using limits derived from our own analysis. In both cases, we find good agreement with Wielen's results to MV ˜+11, but lower densities at the maximum (MV˜+12). The latter analysis results in a luminosity function, PhiCNS, which closely matches photometric parallax analyses for MV<+11 and MV>+14 -- we do not recover the apparent excess of low-luminosity stars inferred from analysis of the 5 pc sample. However, PhiCNS does lie below Phiphot at the peak (MV˜12), and we suggest that this offset is caused by the inclusion of unrecognized binaries in the photometric surveys. We have also reanalyzed the local stellar kinematics using the complete sample and find that the velocity distributions show significant departures from single Gaussian velocity dispersions.},

	abstract = {We describe a method for accurately determining M dwarf metallicities with spectral synthesis based on abundance analyses of visual binary stars. We obtained high-resolution, high-signal-to-noise ratio spectra of each component of five visual binary pairs at McDonald Observatory. The spectral types of the components range from F7 to K3 V for the primaries and from M0.5 to M3.5 V for the secondaries. We have determined the metallicities of the primaries differentially with respect to the Sun by fitting synthetic spectra to Fe I line profiles in the observed spectra. In the course of our analysis of the M dwarf secondaries, we have made significant improvements to the PHOENIX cool-star model atmospheres and the spectrum analysis code MOOG. Our analysis yields an rms deviation of 0.11 dex in metallicity values between the binary pairs. We estimate the uncertainties in the derived stellar parameters for the M dwarfs to be 48 K, 0.10 dex, 0.12 dex, 0.15 km s-1, and 0.20 km s-1 for Teff, logg, [M/H], xi, and eta, respectively. Accurate stellar evolutionary models are needed to progress further in the analysis of cool-star spectra; the new model atmospheres warrant recalculation of the evolutionary models.},

However, there are no isochrones and self-consistent HB tracks available in the literature that are based on the up-to-date input physics and wide ranges of He and metal abundances. Here we present new sets of Y 2 isochrones and HB evolutionary tracks with the effects of He enhancements. The most up-to-date input physics are adopted, and the effects of alpha-enhancements ([alpha/Fe]=0.3) are also fully taken into account. These isochrones and tracks have been constructed for more realistic evolutionary population syntheses for old stellar populations, such as GCs and elliptical galaxies. The new isochrones and HB tracks well reproduce the observed color magnitude diagrams of Galactic GCs, including peculiar features observed in the HB and MS of omega Centauri and NGC 2808.},

	abstract = {We present a method for the photometric selection of metal-poor halo giants from the imaging data of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey9 (SDSS). These stars are offset from the stellar locus in the g-r versus u-g color-color diagram. Based on a sample of 29 candidates for which spectra were taken, we derive a selection efficiency of the order of 50% for stars brighter than r~17mag. The candidates selected in 400 deg2 of sky from the SDSS Early Data Release trace the known halo structures (tidal streams from the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy and the Draco dwarf spheroidal galaxy), indicating that such a color-selected sample can be used to study the halo structure even without spectroscopic information. This method, and supplemental techniques for selecting halo stars, such as RR Lyrae stars and other blue horizontal-branch stars, can produce an unprecedented three-dimensional map of the Galactic halo based on the SDSS imaging survey.},

	abstract = {We estimate the strength of the bandpass-integrated thermal emission from the extrasolar planet TrES-4 at 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, and 8.0 mu using the Infrared Array Camera on the Spitzer Space Telescope. We find relative eclipse depths of 0.137% $\pm$ 0.011%, 0.148% $\pm$ 0.016%, 0.261% $\pm$ 0.059%, and 0.318% $\pm$ 0.044% in these four bandpasses, respectively. We also place a 2sigma upper limit of 0.37% on the depth of the secondary eclipse in the 16 mu IRS peak-up array. These eclipse depths reveal that TrES-4 has an emission spectrum similar to that of HD 209458b, which requires the presence of water emission bands created by a thermal inversion layer high in the atmosphere in order to explain the observed features. TrES-4 receives more radiation from its star than HD 209458b and has a correspondingly higher effective temperature, therefore the presence of a temperature inversion in this planet's atmosphere lends support to the idea that inversions might be correlated with the irradiance received by the planet. We find no evidence for any offset in the timing of the secondary eclipse, and place a 3sigma upper limit of |ecos(omega)| < 0.0058, where e is the planet's orbital eccentricity and omega is the argument of pericenter. From this we conclude that tidal heating from ongoing orbital circularization is unlikely to be the explanation for TrES-4's inflated radius.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we describe the photometric calibration of data taken with the near-infrared Wide Field Camera (WFCAM) on the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope (UKIRT). The broad-band ZYJHK data are directly calibrated from Two-Micron All-Sky Survey (2MASS) point sources which are abundant in every WFCAM pointing. We perform an analysis of spatial systematics in the photometric calibration, both inter- and intradetector show that these are present at up to the ~5per cent level in WFCAM. Although the causes of these systematics are not yet fully understood, a method for their removal is developed and tested. Following the application of the correction procedure, the photometric calibration of WFCAM is found to be accurate to ~=1.5per cent for the JHK bands and 2per cent for the ZY bands, meeting the survey requirements. We investigate the transformations between the 2MASS and WFCAM systems and find that the Z and Y calibrations are sensitive to the effects of interstellar reddening for large values of E(B - V)', but that the JHK filters remain largely unaffected. We measure a small correction to the WFCAM Y-band photometry required to place WFCAM on a Vega system, and investigate WFCAM measurements of published standard stars from the list of UKIRT faint standards. Finally, we present empirically determined throughput measurements for WFCAM.},

	abstract = {Context: In analyses of stellar spectra and colours, and for the analysis of integrated light from galaxies, a homogeneous grid of model atmospheres of late-type stars and corresponding flux spectra is needed. Aims: We construct an extensive grid of spherically-symmetric models (supplemented with plane-parallel ones for the highest surface gravities), built on up-to-date atomic and molecular data, and make it available for public use.  Methods: The most recent version of the MARCS program is used.  Results: We present a grid of about 104 model atmospheres for stars with 2500 K <= T_eff <= 8000 K, -1 <= log g = log (GM/R^2) <= 5 (cgs) with various masses and radii, -5 <= [Me/H] <= +1, with [ alpha/Fe] = 0.0 and 0.4 and different choices of C and N abundances. This includes ``CN-cycled'' models with C/N = 4.07 (solar), 1.5 and 0.5, C/O ranging from 0.09 to (normally) 5.0 to also represent stars of spectral types R, S and N, and with 1.0 <= xit <= 5 km s-1. We also list thermodynamic quantities (T, P_g, P_e, rho, partial pressures of molecules, etc.) and provide them on the World Wide Web, as well as calculated fluxes in approximately 108 000 wavelength points. Underlying assumptions in addition to 1D stratification (spherical or plane-parallel) include hydrostatic equilibrium, mixing-length convection and local thermodynamic equilibrium. We discuss a number of general properties of the models, in particular in relation to the effects of changing abundances, of blanketing, and of sphericity. We illustrate positive and negative feedbacks between sphericity and molecular blanketing. We compare the models with those of other available grids and find excellent agreement with plane-parallel models of Castelli & Kurucz (if convection is treated consistently) within the overlapping parameter range. Although there are considerable departures from the spherically-symmetric NextGen models, the agreement with more recent PHOENIX models is gratifying. Conclusions: The models of the grid show considerable regularities, but some interesting departures from general patterns occur for the coolest models due to the molecular opacities. We have tested a number of approximate ``rules of thumb'' concerning effects of blanketing and sphericity and often found them to be astonishingly accurate. Some interesting new phenomena have been discovered and explored, such as the intricate coupling between blanketing and sphericity, and the strong effects of carbon enhancement on metal-poor models. We give further details of line absorption data for molecules, as well as details of models and comparisons with observations in subsequent papers.},

	abstract = {The Kepler Mission began its 3.5 year photometric monitoring campaign in 2009 May on a select group of approximately 150,000 stars. The stars were chosen from the ~ half million in the field of view that are brighter than 16th magnitude. The selection criteria are quantitative metrics designed to optimize the scientific yield of the mission with regard to the detection of Earth-size planets in the habitable zone. This yields more than 90,000 G-type stars on or close to the main sequence, >20, 000 of which are brighter than 14th magnitude. At the temperature extremes, the sample includes approximately 3000 M-type dwarfs and a small sample of O- and B-type MS stars (<200). The small numbers of giants are included in the sample: ~5000 stars with surface gravities log(g) < 3.5. We present a brief summary of the selection process and the stellar populations it yields in terms of surface gravity, effective temperature, and apparent magnitude. In addition to the primary, statistically derived target set, several ancillary target lists were manually generated to enhance the science of the mission, examples being: known eclipsing binaries, open cluster members, and high proper motion stars.},

	abstract = {We present a method for isolating a clean sample of red giant branch stars in the outer regions of M31. Our study is based on an ongoing spectroscopic survey using the DEIMOS instrument on the Keck II 10 m telescope. The survey aims to study the kinematics, (sub)structure, and metallicity of M31's halo. Although most of our spectroscopic targets were photometrically screened to reject foreground Milky Way dwarf star contaminants, dwarf stars still constitute a substantial fraction of the observed spectra in the sparse outer halo. Our likelihood-based method for isolating M31 red giants uses five criteria: (1) radial velocity, (2) photometry in the intermediate-width DDO51 band to measure the strength of the MgH/Mg b absorption features, (3) strength of the Na I lambda8190 absorption line doublet, (4) location within an (I, V-I) color-magnitude diagram, and (5) comparison of photometric (color-magnitude diagram based) versus spectroscopic (Ca II lambda8500 triplet based) metallicity estimates. We also discuss other potential giant/dwarf separation criteria: the strength of the K I absorption lines at 7665 and 7699 {\AA} and the TiO bands at 7100, 7600, and 8500 {\AA}. Training sets consisting of definite M31 red giants and Galactic dwarf stars are used to derive empirical probability distribution functions for each diagnostic. These functions are used to calculate the likelihood that a given star is a red giant in M31 versus a Milky Way dwarf star. Using our diagnostic method, we isolate 40 M31 red giants beyond a projected distance of R=60 kpc from the galaxy's center, including three red giants at R~165 kpc. The ability to identify individual M31 red giant stars gives us an unprecedented level of sensitivity in studying the properties of the galaxy's outer halo.},

@article{Schlaufman2010,
	abstract = {The location of M dwarfs in the (V-Ks)-MKs color-magnitude diagram (CMD) has been shown to correlate with metallicity. We demonstrate that previous empirical photometric calibrations of M dwarf metallicity exploiting this correlation systematically underestimate or overestimate metallicity at the extremes of their range. We improve upon previous calibrations in three ways. First, we use both a volume-limited and kinematically-matched sample of F and G dwarfs from the Geneva-Copehnagen Survey (GCS) to infer the mean metallicity of M dwarfs in the Solar Neighborhood. Second, we use theoretical models of M dwarf interiors and atmospheres to determine the effect of metallicity on M dwarfs in the (V-Ks)-MKs CMD. Third, though we use the GCS to infer the mean metallicity of M dwarfs in the Solar Neighborhood, our final calibration is based purely on high-resolution spectroscopy of FGK primaries with M dwarf companions as well as the trigonometric parallaxes and apparent V- and Ks-band magnitudes of those M dwarf companions. As a result, our photometric calibration explains an order of magnitude more of the variance in the calibration sample than previous photometric calibrations. We use our calibration to non-parametrically quantify the significance of the observation that M dwarfs that host exoplanets are preferentially in a region of the (V-Ks)-MKs plane populated by metal-rich M dwarfs. We find that the probability p that planet-hosting M dwarfs are distributed across the (V-Ks)-MKs CMD in the same way as field M dwarfs is p = 0.06 $\pm$ 0.008. Interestingly, the subsample of M dwarfs that host Neptune and sub-Neptune mass planets may also be preferentially located in the region of the V-Ks)-MKs plane populated by high-metallicity M dwarfs. The probability of this occurrence by chance is p = 0.40 $\pm$ 0.02, and this observation hints that low-mass planets may be more likely to be found around metal-rich M dwarfs. The confirmation of this hint would be in contrast to the result obtained for FGK stars, where it appears that metal-rich and metal-poor stars hosts Neptune-mass planets with approximately equal probability. An increased rate of low-mass planet occurrence around metal-rich M dwarfs would be a natural consequence of the core-accretion model of planet formation.},

	abstract = {Knowledge of the metallicities of M dwarfs rests predominantly on the photometric calibration of Bonfils and collaborators, which predicts that M dwarfs in the solar neighborhood, including those with known planets, are systematically metal poor compared to their higher-mass counterparts. We test this prediction using a volume-limited sample of low-mass stars, together with a subset of M dwarfs with high-metallicity, F, G, and K wide binary companions. We find that the Bonfils et al. photometric calibration systematically underestimates the metallicities of our high-metallicity M dwarfs by an average of 0.32 dex. We derive a new photometric metallicity calibration and show that M dwarfs with planets appear to be systematically metal rich, a result that is consistent with the metallicity distribution of FGK dwarfs with planets.},

	abstract = {Correlations between stellar properties and the occurrence rate of exoplanets can be used to inform the target selection of future planet-search efforts and provide valuable clues about the planet-formation process. We analyze a sample of 1266 stars drawn from the California Planet Survey targets to determine the empirical functional form describing the likelihood of a star harboring a giant planet as a function of its mass and metallicity. Our stellar sample ranges from M dwarfs with masses as low as 0.2 M to intermediate-mass subgiants with masses as high as 1.9 M. In agreement with previous studies, our sample exhibits a planet-metallicity correlation at all stellar masses; the fraction of stars that harbor giant planets scales as f∝10. We can rule out a flat metallicity relationship among our evolved stars (at 98% confidence), which argues that the high metallicities of stars with planets is not likely due to convective envelope "pollution." Our data also rule out a constant planet occurrence rate for [Fe/H]<0, indicating that giant planets continue to become rarer at sub-Solar metallicities. We also find that planet occurrence increases with stellar mass (f∝M), characterized by a rise from 3% around M dwarfs (0.5 M) to 14% around A stars (2 M), at Solar metallicity. We argue that the correlation between stellar properties and giant planet occurrence is strong supporting evidence of the core-accretion model of planet formation.},

	abstract = {The fundamental properties of low-mass stars are not as well understood as those of their more massive counterparts. The best method for constraining these properties, especially masses and radii, is to study eclipsing binary systems, but only a small number of late-type (>=M0) systems have been identified and well characterized to date. We present the discovery and characterization of six new M dwarf eclipsing binary systems. The 12 stars in these eclipsing systems have masses spanning 0.38-0.59 M sun and orbital periods of 0.6-1.7 days, with typical uncertainties of ~0.3% in mass and ~0.5%-2.0% in radius. Combined with six known systems with high-precision measurements, our results reveal an intriguing trend in the low-mass regime. For stars with M= 0.35-0.80 M sun, components in short-period binary systems (Plsim1 day; 12 stars) have radii which are inflated by up to 10% (mu = 4.8% $\pm$ 1.0%) with respect to evolutionary models for low-mass main-sequence stars, whereas components in longer-period systems (>1.5 days; 12 stars) tend to have smaller radii (mu = 1.7% $\pm$ 0.7%). This trend supports the hypothesis that short-period systems are inflated by the influence of the close companion, most likely because they are tidally locked into very high rotation speeds that enhance activity and inhibit convection. In summary, very close binary systems are not representative of typical M dwarfs, but our results for longer-period systems indicate that the evolutionary models are broadly valid in the M~ 0.35-0.80 M sun regime.},

We obtain a convenient form of estimaton of this effect in the long exposure regime, when the turbulence shift produced by the wind is much larger than the aperture of the telescope. A simple method is proposed to determine index S 3 introduced by Kenyon et al. (2006), directly from the measurements with the Multi Aperture Scintillation Sensor (MASS) without information on vertical profile of the wind. The statistics S 3 resulting from our campaign of 2005-2007 at Maidanak observatory is presented. It is shown that these data can be used to estimate high-altitude winds at pressure level 70-100 mbar. Comparison with the wind speed retrieved from the NCEP/NCAR global models shows a good agreement. Some prospects for retrieval of the wind speed profile from the MASS measurements are outlined.},

	abstract = {We analyze 8 years of precise radial velocity measurements from the Keck Planet Search, characterizing the detection threshold, selection effects, and completeness of the survey. We first carry out a systematic search for planets, by assessing the false-alarm probability associated with Keplerian orbit fits to the data. This allows us to understand the detection threshold for each star in terms of the number and time baseline of the observations, and the underlying "noise" from measurement errors, intrinsic stellar jitter, or additional low-mass planets. We show that all planets with orbital periods P < 2000 days, velocity amplitudes K > 20 m s-1, and eccentricities e ≲ 0.6 have been announced, and we summarize the candidates at lower amplitudes and longer orbital periods. For the remaining stars, we calculate upper limits on the velocity amplitude of a companion. For orbital periods less than the duration of the observations, these are typically 10 m s-1 and increase ∝ P2 for longer periods. We then use the nondetections to derive completeness corrections at low amplitudes and long orbital periods and discuss the resulting distribution of minimum mass and orbital period. We give the fraction of stars with a planet as a function of minimum mass and orbital period and extrapolate to long-period orbits and low planet masses. A power-law fit for planet masses >0.3 MJ and periods < 2000 days gives a mass-period distribution dN = CMalphaPbetad ln Md ln P with alpha = -0.31 $\pm$ 0.2, beta = 0.26 $\pm$ 0.1, and the normalization constant C such that 10.5% of solar type stars have a planet with mass in the range 0.3--10 MJ and orbital period 2--2000 days. The orbital period distribution shows an increase in the planet fraction by a factor of ≈5 for orbital periods ≳ 300 days. Extrapolation gives 17%--20% of stars having gas giant planets within 20 AU. Finally, we constrain the occurrence rate of planets orbiting M dwarfs compared to FGK dwarfs, taking into account differences in detectability.},

	abstract = {We find that Kepler exoplanet candidate (EC) host stars are preferentially metal rich, including the low-mass stellar hosts of small-radius ECs. The last observation confirms a tentative hint that there is a correlation between the metallicity of low-mass stars and the presence of low-mass and small-radius exoplanets. In particular, we compare the J-H-g-r color-color distribution of Kepler EC host stars with a control sample of dwarf stars selected from the ~150, 000 stars observed during Q1 and Q2 of the Kepler mission but with no detected planets. We find that at J - H = 0.30 characteristic of solar-type stars, the average g-r color of stars that host giant ECs is 4sigma redder than the average color of the stars in the control sample. At the same J - H color, the average g-r color of solar-type stars that host small-radius ECs is indistinguishable from the average color of the stars in the control sample. In addition, we find that at J - H = 0.62 indicative of late K dwarfs, the average g-r color of stars that host small-radius ECs is 4sigma redder than the average color of the stars in the control sample. These offsets are unlikely to be caused by differential reddening, age differences between the two populations, or the presence of giant stars in the control sample. Stellar models suggest that the first color offset is due to a 0.2 dex enhancement in [Fe/H] of the giant EC host population at M * ≈ 1 M sun, while Sloan photometry of M 67 and NGC 6791 suggests that the second color offset is due to a similar [Fe/H] enhancement of the small-radius EC host population at M * ≈ 0.7 M sun. These correlations are a natural consequence of the core-accretion model of planet formation.},

	abstract = {Chemical abundances in exoplanet-hosting stars, in comparison to stars which do not harbor known planets, have been found to exhibit intriguing differences in their respective abundance distributions. These chemical differences provide clues to how planets form, as well as how the parent star properties, most importantly the mass and total metallicity, affect the type of planetary system that forms. The program proposed here will carry out a detailed stellar parameter and chemical abundance analysis of a sample of planet-hosting stars uncovered by the Kepler spacecraft as transiting systems. As only a relatively small number of detailed abundance analyses have been undertaken on stars which host planetary systems having their most massive planets being of roughly Neptunian-mass or smaller, this study will focus on Neptunian-sized planets in order to test the possibility that stellar metallicity may play an important role in setting the sizes of planets in different planetary systems.},

	abstract = {Doppler measurements from Keck exhibit a sinusoidal periodicity in the velocities of the G0 dwarf HD 209458, having a semiamplitude of 81 m s-1 and a period of 3.5239 days, which is indicative of a ``51 Peg-like'' planet with a minimum mass (Msini) of 0.62 MJup and a semimajor axis of 0.046 AU. Follow-up photometry reveals a drop of 0.017 mag at the predicted time (within the errors) of transit by the companion based on the velocities. This is the first extrasolar planet observed to transit its star. The radius of the planet derived from the magnitude of the dimming is 1.42 RJup, which is consistent with models of irradiated Jupiter-mass planets. The transit implies that sini>0.993, leading to a true mass of 0.62 MJup for the planet. The resulting mean density of 0.27 g cm-3 implies that the companion is a gas giant.},

	abstract = {We present an all-sky catalog of M dwarf stars with apparent infrared magnitude J < 10. The 8889 stars are selected from the ongoing SUPERBLINK survey of stars with proper motion mu > 40 mas yr--1, supplemented on the bright end with the Tycho-2 catalog. Completeness tests which account for kinematic (proper motion) bias suggest that our catalog represents ≈75% of the estimated ~11, 900 M dwarfs with J < 10 expected to populate the entire sky. Our catalog is, however, significantly more complete for the northern sky (≈90%) than it is for the south (≈60%). Stars are identified as cool, red M dwarfs from a combination of optical and infrared color cuts, and are distinguished from background M giants and highly reddened stars using either existing parallax measurements or, if such measurements are lacking, using their location in an optical-to-infrared reduced proper motion diagram. These bright M dwarfs are all prime targets for exoplanet surveys using the Doppler radial velocity or transit methods; the combination of low-mass and bright apparent magnitude should make possible the detection of Earth-size planets on short-period orbits using currently available techniques. Parallax measurements, when available, and photometric distance estimates are provided for all stars, and these place most systems within 60 pc of the Sun. Spectral type estimated from V -- J color shows that most of the stars range from K7 to M4, with only a few late M dwarfs, all within 20 pc. Proximity to the Sun also makes these stars good targets for high-resolution exoplanet imaging searches, especially if younger objects can be identified on the basis of X-ray or UV excess. For that purpose, we include X-ray flux from ROSAT and FUV/NUV ultraviolet magnitudes from GALEX for all stars for which a counterpart can be identified in those catalogs. Additional photometric data include optical magnitudes from Digitized Sky Survey plates and infrared magnitudes from the Two Micron All Sky Survey.},

@article{Mann2010,
	abstract = {We present 230 realizations of a numerical model of planet formation in systems without gas giants. These represent a scenario in which protoplanets grow in a region of a circumstellar disk where water ice condenses and the surface density of solids is enhanced (the "ice line"), but fail to accrete massive gas envelopes before the gaseous disk is dispersed. Each simulation consists of a small number of gravitationally interacting oligarchs (protoplanets) and a much larger number of small bodies that represent the natal disk of planetesimals. Time zero of each simulation represents the epoch at which the gas has disappeared, and the dynamics are integrated for 5 billion years (Gyr). We investigate systems with varying initial number of oligarchs, oligarch spacing, location of the ice line, total mass in the ice line, and oligarch mean density. Systems become chaotic in ~1 Myr but settle into stable configurations in 10-100 Myr. We find: (1) runs consistently produce a 5-9 M ⊕ planet at a semimajor axis of 0.25-0.6 times the position of the ice line, (2) the distribution of planets' orbital eccentricities is distinct from, and skewed toward lower values than the observed distribution of (giant) exoplanet orbits, (3) Inner systems of two dominant planets (e.g., Earth and Venus) are not stable or do not form because of the gravitational influence of the innermost icy planet. The planets predicted by our model are unlikely to be detected by current Doppler observations. Microlensing is currently sensitive to the most massive planets found in our simulations, and may have already found several analogs. A scenario where up to 60% of stars host systems such as those we simulate is consistent with all the available data. We predict that, if this scenario holds, the NASA Kepler spacecraft will detect about 120 planets by two or more transits over the course of its 3.5 yr mission. Furthermore, we predict detectable transit timing variations exceeding 20 minutes due to the presence of additional outer planets. Future microlensing surveys will detect ~130 analogs over a 5 yr survey, including a handful of multiple-planet systems. Finally, the Space Interferometry Mission (SIM-Lite) should be capable of detecting 96% of the innermost icy planets over the course of a 5 yr mission.},

	abstract = {We present evolutionary models for low mass stars from 0.075 to 1 M_sun for solar-type metallicities [M/H]= 0 and -0.5. The calculations include the most recent interior physics and the latest generation of non-grey atmosphere models. We provide mass-age-color-magnitude relationships for both metallicities. The mass-M_V and mass-M_K relations are in excellent agreement with the empirical relations derived observationally. The theoretical color-magnitude diagrams are compared with the sequences of globular clusters (47 Tucanae) and open clusters (NGC2420 and NGC2477) observed with the Hubble Space Telescope. Comparison is also made with field star sequences in M_V-(V-I), M_K-(I-K) and M_K-(J-K) diagrams. These comparisons show that the most recent improvements performed in low-mass star atmosphere models yield now reliable stellar models in the near-infrared. These models can be used for metallicity, mass, temperature and luminosity calibrations. Uncertainties still remain, however, in the optical spectral region below T_eff ~ 3700K, where predicted (V-I) colors are too blue by 0.5 mag for a given magnitude. The possible origins for such a discrepancy, most likely a missing source of opacity in the optical and the onset of grain formation are examined in detail.

Near-infrared photometry (JHK bands) was obtained on about 40 nearby (all with greater than 0.04 arcsec) low-mass taken from the Gliese catalogs. From these data and from previously published UBVRI magnitudes, effective temperatures are determined in the standard manner, by fitting blackbody energy distributions to the observed fluxes while allowing for line and band blocking below 1 micron. Together with the known distances, these temperatures and fluxes allow estimates of the radii and luminosities of these stars. Invoking a theoretical mass-luminosity relation, the masses of the stars can then be derived. A comparison of the resultant empirical mass-radius relation with a recent theoretical relation shows that the discrepancy is now about 10 percent, significantly better than the 20-25 percent obtained a decade ago.},

We use these new data, together with literature measurements, to examine the luminosity-radius and mass-radius relations for K and M dwarfs. The precision of the new interferometric radii now competes with what can be obtained for double-lined eclipsing binaries. Interferometry provides access to much less active stars, as well as to stars with much better measured distances and luminosities, and therefore complements the information obtained from eclipsing systems. The radii of magnetically quiet late-K to M dwarfs match the predictions of stellar evolution models very well, providing direct confirmation that magnetic activity explains the discrepancy that was recently found for magnetically active eclipsing systems. The radii of the early K dwarfs are reproduced well for a mixing length parameter that approaches the solar value, as qualitatively expected.

Our modelling technique has uncovered some of the largest known critical curves outlined by many accurately predicted sets of multiple images. The distribution of Einstein radii has a median value of ~=28 arcsec (for a source redshift of zs˜ 2), twice as large as other lower z samples, and extends to 55 arcsec for MACS J0717.5+3745, with an impressive enclosed Einstein mass of 7.4 × 1014 M&sun;. We find that nine clusters cover a very large area (>2.5 arcmin2) of high magnification (mu > 10×) for a source redshift of zs˜ 8, providing primary targets for accessing the first stars and galaxies. We compare our results with theoretical predictions of the standard Lambda cold dark matter (LambdaCDM) model which we show systematically fall short of our measured Einstein radii by a factor of ~=1.4, after accounting for the effect of lensing projection. Nevertheless, a revised analysis, once arc redshifts become available, and similar analyses of larger samples, is needed in order to establish more precisely the level of discrepancy with LambdaCDM predictions.},

	abstract = {Both ground- and space-based transit observatories are poised to significantly increase the number of known transiting planets and the number of precisely measured transit times. The variation in a planet's transit times may be used to infer the presence of additional planets. Deducing the masses and orbital parameters of such planets from transit time variations (TTVs) alone is a rich and increasingly relevant dynamical problem. In this work, we evaluate the extent of the degeneracies in this process, systematically explore the dependence of TTV signals on several parameters, and provide phase space plots that could aid observers in planning future observations. Our explorations are focused on a likely-to-be prevalent situation: a known transiting short-period Neptune- or Jupiter-sized planet and a suspected external low-mass perturber on a nearly coplanar orbit. Through ~107 N-body simulations, we demonstrate how TTV signal amplitudes may vary by orders of magnitude due to slight variations in any one orbital parameter (10-3 AU in a semimajor axis, 0.005 in eccentricity, or a few degrees in orbital angles), and quantify the number of consecutive transit observations necessary in order to obtain a reasonable opportunity of characterizing the unseen planet (gsim50 observations). Planets in or near period commensurabilities of the form p:q, where p <= 20 and q <= 3, produce distinct TTV signatures, regardless of whether the planets are actually locked in a mean motion resonance. We distinguish these systems from the secular systems in our explorations. Additionally, we find that computing the autocorrelation function of a TTV signal can provide a useful diagnostic for identifying possible orbits for additional planets and suggest that this method could aid integration of TTV signals in future studies of particular exosystems.},

To quantitatively test the merger-halo connection, we present the first statistical study based on deep radio data and X-ray observations of a complete X-ray-selected sample of galaxy clusters with X-ray luminosity >=5 × 1044 erg s-1 and redshift 0.2 <= z <= 0.32. Using several methods to characterize cluster substructures, namely, the power ratios, centroid shift, and X-ray brightness concentration parameter, we show that clusters with and without RH can be quantitatively differentiated in terms of their dynamical properties. In particular, we confirm that RHs are associated with dynamically disturbed clusters and clusters without RH are more "relaxed," with only a couple of exceptions where a disturbed cluster does not exhibit a halo.},

	abstract = {We present evidence for a correlation between the observed properties of hot Jupiter emission spectra and the activity levels of the host stars measured using Ca II H & K emission lines. We find that planets with dayside emission spectra that are well-described by standard one-dimensional atmosphere models with water in absorption (HD 189733, TrES-1, TrES-3, WASP-4) orbit chromospherically active stars, while planets with emission spectra that are consistent with the presence of a strong high-altitude temperature inversion and water in emission orbit quieter stars. We estimate that active G and K stars have Lyman alpha fluxes that are typically a factor of 4-7 times higher than quiet stars with analogous spectral types and propose that the increased UV flux received by planets orbiting active stars destroys the compounds responsible for the formation of the observed temperature inversions. In this paper, we also derive a model-independent method for differentiating between these two atmosphere types using the secondary eclipse depths measured in the 3.6 and 4.5 mum bands on the Spitzer Space Telescope and argue that the observed correlation is independent of the inverted/non-inverted paradigm for classifying hot Jupiter atmospheres.

@article{Rafikov:2004rr,
	abstract = {We explore the dynamics of small planetesimals coexisting with massive protoplanetary cores in a gaseous nebula. Gas drag strongly affects the motion of small bodies, leading to the decay of their eccentricities and inclinations, which are excited by the gravity of protoplanetary cores. Drag acting on larger (>~1 km), high-velocity planetesimals causes a mere reduction of their average random velocity. By contrast, drag qualitatively changes the dynamics of smaller (<~0.1-1 km), low-velocity objects: (1) small planetesimals sediment toward the midplane of the nebula, forming a vertically thin subdisk; (2) their random velocities rapidly decay between successive passages of the cores, and as a result, encounters with cores typically occur at the minimum relative velocity allowed by the shear in the disk. This leads to a drastic increase in the accretion rate of small planetesimals by the protoplanetary cores, allowing cores to grow faster than expected in the simple oligarchic picture, provided that the population of small planetesimals contains more than roughly 1% of the solid mass in the nebula. Fragmentation of larger planetesimals (>~1 km) in energetic collisions triggered by the gravitational scattering by cores can easily channel this amount of material into small bodies on reasonable timescales (<1 Myr in the outer solar system), providing a means for the rapid growth (within several million years at 30 AU) of rather massive protoplanetary cores. Effects of inelastic collisions between planetesimals and presence of multiple protoplanetary cores are discussed.},

In 2009, we collected nine light curves of eight transits of the exoplanet WASP-10b. Combining these data with those published, we have found that transit timing cannot be explained by a constant period but by a periodic variation. Simplified three-body models, which reproduce the observed variations of timing residuals, were identified by numerical simulations. We have found that the configuration with an additional planet with a mass of ˜0.1 MJ and an orbital period of ˜5.23 d, located close to the outer 5 : 3 mean motion resonance, is the most likely scenario. If the second planet is a transiter, the estimated flux drop will be ˜0.3 per cent and can be observed with a ground-based telescope. Moreover, we present evidence that the spots on the stellar surface and the rotation of the star affect the radial-velocity curve, giving rise to a spurious eccentricity of the orbit of the first planet. We argue that the orbit of WASP-10b is essentially circular. Using the gyrochronology method, the host star was found to be 270 $\pm$ 80 Myr old. This young age can explain the large radius reported for WASP-10b. Partly based on observations made with the 0.6- and 2.0-m telescopes of the Rozhen National Astronomical Observatory, which is operated by the Institute of Astronomy, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, and the 90-cm telescope of the University Observatory Jena, which is operated by the Astrophysical Institute of the Friedrich Schiller University.},

	abstract = {We present high-precision photometry of three transits of the extrasolar planetary system WASP-2, obtained by defocusing the telescopes, and achieving scatters of between 0.42 and 0.73 mmag versus the best-fitting model. These data are modelled using the JKTEBOP code, and taking into account the light from the recently discovered faint star close to the system. The physical properties of the WASP-2 system are derived using tabulated predictions from five different sets of stellar evolutionary models, allowing both statistical and systematic error bars to be specified. We find the mass and radius of the planet to be Mb = 0.846 +/- 0.055 +/- 0.023MJup and Rb = 1.043 +/- 0.029 +/- 0.015RJup. It has a low equilibrium temperature of 1281 +/- 21K, in agreement with a recent finding that it does not have an atmospheric temperature inversion. The first of our transit data sets has a scatter of only 0.42mmag with respect to the best-fitting light-curve model, which to our knowledge is a record for ground-based observations of a transiting extrasolar planetary system.

@article{Torres:2011bh,
	abstract = {Light curves from the Kepler Mission contain valuable information on the nature of the phenomena producing the transit-like signals. To assist in exploring the possibility that they are due to an astrophysical false positive, we describe a procedure (BLENDER) to model the photometry in terms of a "blend" rather than a planet orbiting a star. A blend may consist of a background or foreground eclipsing binary (or star-planet pair) whose eclipses are attenuated by the light of the candidate and possibly other stars within the photometric aperture. We apply BLENDER to the case of Kepler-9 (KIC 3323887), a target harboring two previously confirmed Saturn-size planets (Kepler-9 b and Kepler-9 c) showing transit timing variations, and an additional shallower signal with a 1.59 day period suggesting the presence of a super-Earth-size planet. Using BLENDER together with constraints from other follow-up observations we are able to rule out all blends for the two deeper signals and provide independent validation of their planetary nature. For the shallower signal, we rule out a large fraction of the false positives that might mimic the transits. The false alarm rate for remaining blends depends in part (and inversely) on the unknown frequency of small-size planets. Based on several realistic estimates of this frequency, we conclude with very high confidence that this small signal is due to a super-Earth-size planet (Kepler-9 d) in a multiple system, rather than a false positive. The radius is determined to be 1.64+0.19 -0.14 R ⊕, and current spectroscopic observations are as yet insufficient to establish its mass.},

	abstract = {We observed 7 new transits of the ``hot Jupiter'' WASP-5b using a 61 cm telescope located in New Zealand, in order to search for transit timing variations (TTVs), which can be induced by additional bodies existing in the system. Combining them with other available photometric and radial velocity (RV) data, we find that its transit timings do not match a linear ephemeris; the best-fit chi2 value is 32.2 with 9 degrees of freedom, which corresponds to a confidence level of 99.982% or 3.7sigma. This result indicates that excess variations of transit timings have been observed, either due to unknown systematic effects, or possibly due to real TTVs. The TTV amplitude is as large as 50 s, and if this is real it cannot be explained by some effect other than an additional body, or bodies. From RV data, we put an upper limit on the RV amplitude caused by a possible secondary body (planet) as 21 m s-1, which corresponds to its mass of 22-70M⊕ over the orbital period ratio of the two planets from 0.2 to 5.0. From the TTV data, using numerical simulations, we narrowed the limits down to 2M⊕ near 1:2 and 2:1 mean-motion resonances (MMRs) with WASP-5b at the 3sigma level, assuming that the two planets are co-planer. We also put an upper limit of 43M⊕ (3sigma) on excess of Trojan mass using both RV and photometric data. We also find that if the orbit of the possible secondary planet is a circle or an ellipse of small eccentricity, it would be likely an orbit near that of low-order MMRs.},

The technique allows a search for variations in either the transit duration or the center induced by the perturbation of a third body, e.g. a second planet or an exomoon. By applying this method, the TASTE (The Asiago search for transit timing variations of Exoplanets) project will collect high-precision, short-cadence light curves for a selected sample of transits by using imaging differential photometry at the Asiago 1.82 m telescope. The first light curves show that our project can achieve a competitive timing accuracy, as well as a significant improvement of the orbital parameters.

	abstract = {The super-Earth GJ1214b transits a nearby M dwarf that exhibits a 1% intrinsic variability in the near-infrared. Here, we analyze new observations to refine the physical properties of both the star and planet. We present three years of out-of-transit photometric monitoring of the stellar host GJ1214 from the MEarth Observatory and find the rotation period to be long, most likely an integer multiple of 53 days, suggesting low levels of magnetic activity and an old age for the system. We show that such variability will not pose significant problems to ongoing studies of the planet's atmosphere with transmission spectroscopy. We analyze two high-precision transit light curves from ESO's Very Large Telescope (VLT) along with seven others from the MEarth and Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory 1.2 m telescopes, finding physical parameters for the planet that are consistent with previous work. The VLT light curves show tentative evidence for spot occultations during transit. Using two years of MEarth light curves, we place limits on additional transiting planets around GJ1214 with periods out to the habitable zone of the system. We also improve upon the previous photographic V-band estimate for the star, finding V = 14.71 $\pm$ 0.03.},

Four of the visible-light (g, r, i, z) magnitudes used in the KIC are tied to Sloan Digital Sky Survey magnitudes; the fifth (D51) is an AB magnitude calibrated to be consistent with Castelli & Kurucz (CK) model atmosphere fluxes. We derived atmospheric extinction corrections from hourly observations of secondary standard fields within the Kepler field of view. For these filters and extinction estimates, repeatability of absolute photometry for stars brighter than magnitude 15 is typically 2%. We estimated stellar parameters {T eff, log (g), log (Z), E B - V } using Bayesian posterior probability maximization to match observed colors to CK stellar atmosphere models. We applied Bayesian priors describing the distribution of solar-neighborhood stars in the color-magnitude diagram, in log (Z), and in height above the galactic plane. Several comparisons with samples of stars classified by other means indicate that for 4500 K <=T eff <= 6500 K, our classifications are reliable within about $\pm$200 K and 0.4 dex in log (g) for dwarfs, with somewhat larger log (g) uncertainties for giants. It is difficult to assess the reliability of our log (Z) estimates, but there is reason to suspect that it is poor, particularly at extreme T eff. Comparisons between the CK models and observed colors are generally satisfactory with some exceptions, notably for stars cooler than 4500 K. Of great importance for the Kepler mission, for T eff <= 5400 K, comparison with asteroseismic results shows that the distinction between main-sequence stars and giants is reliable with about 98% confidence. Larger errors in log (g) occur for warmer stars, for which our filter set provides inadequate gravity diagnostics. The KIC is available through the MAST data archive.},

@article{Moorhead:2011lr,
	abstract = {Doppler planet searches have discovered that giant planets follow orbits with a wide range of orbital eccentricities, revolutionizing theories of planet formation. The discovery of hundreds of exoplanet candidates by NASA's Kepler mission enables astronomers to characterize the eccentricity distribution of small exoplanets. Measuring the eccentricity of individual planets is only practical in favorable cases that are amenable to complementary techniques (e.g., radial velocities, transit timing variations, occultation photometry). Yet even in the absence of individual eccentricities, it is possible to study the distribution of eccentricities based on the distribution of transit durations (relative to the maximum transit duration for a circular orbit). We analyze the transit duration distribution of Kepler planet candidates. We find that for host stars with T eff > 5100 K we cannot invert this to infer the eccentricity distribution at this time due to uncertainties and possible systematics in the host star densities. With this limitation in mind, we compare the observed transit duration distribution with models to rule out extreme distributions. If we assume a Rayleigh eccentricity distribution for Kepler planet candidates, then we find best fits with a mean eccentricity of 0.1-0.25 for host stars with T eff <= 5100 K. We compare the transit duration distribution for different subsets of Kepler planet candidates and discuss tentative trends with planetary radius and multiplicity. High-precision spectroscopic follow-up observations for a large sample of host stars will be required to confirm which trends are real and which are the results of systematic errors in stellar radii. Finally, we identify planet candidates that must be eccentric or have a significantly underestimated stellar radius.},
