	abstract = {The TRAPPIST-1 system, consisting of an ultracool host star having seven known Earth-sized planets, will be a prime target for atmospheric characterization with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). However, the detectability of atmospheric molecular species may be severely impacted by the presence of clouds and/or hazes. In this work, we perform 3D general circulation model (GCM) simulations with the LMD-G model supplemented by 1D photochemistry simulations at the terminator with the Atmos model to simulate several possible atmospheres for TRAPPIST-1e, 1f, and 1g: (1) modern Earth, (2) Archean Earth, and (3) CO2-rich atmospheres. The JWST synthetic transit spectra were computed using the GSFC Planetary Spectrum Generator. We find that the TRAPPIST-1e, 1f, and 1g atmospheres, with clouds and/or hazes, could be detected using JWST’s NIRSpec Prism from the CO2 absorption line at 4.3 μm in less than 15 transits at 3σ or less than 35 transits at 5σ. However, our analysis suggests that other gases would require hundreds (or thousands) of transits to be detectable. We also find that H2O, mostly confined in the lower atmosphere, is very challenging to detect for these planets or similar systems if the planets’ atmospheres are not in a moist greenhouse state. This result demonstrates that the use of GCMs, self-consistently taking into account the effect of clouds and subsaturation, is crucial to evaluate the detectability of atmospheric molecules of interest, as well as for interpreting future detections in a more global (and thus robust and relevant) approach.},

	abstract = {The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) is expected to discover dozens of temperate terrestrial planets orbiting M-dwarfs with atmospheres that could be followed up with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Currently, the TRAPPIST-1 system serves as a benchmark for determining the feasibility and resources required to yield atmospheric constraints. We assess these questions and leverage an information content analysis to determine observing strategies for yielding high-precision spectroscopy in transmission and emission. Our goal is to guide observing strategies of temperate terrestrial planets in preparation for the early JWST cycles. First, we explore JWST’s current capabilities and expected spectral precision for targets near the saturation limits of specific modes. In doing so, we highlight the enhanced capabilities of high-efficiency readout patterns that are being considered for implementation in Cycle 2. We propose a partial saturation strategy to increase the achievable precision of JWST's NIRSpec Prism. We show that JWST has the potential to detect the dominant absorbing gas in the atmospheres of temperate terrestrial planets by the 10th transit using transmission spectroscopy techniques in the near-infrared (NIR). We also show that stacking ⪆10 transmission spectroscopy observations is unlikely to yield significant improvements in determining atmospheric composition. For emission spectroscopy, we show that the MIRI Low Resolution Spectroscopy (LRS) is unlikely to provide robust constraints on the atmospheric composition of temperate terrestrial planets. Higher-precision emission spectroscopy at wavelengths longward of those accessible to MIRI LRS, as proposed in the Origins Space Telescope concept, could help improve the constraints on molecular abundances of temperate terrestrial planets orbiting M-dwarfs.},

	abstract = {Nine transiting Earth-sized planets have recently been discovered around nearby late-M dwarfs, including the TRAPPIST-1 planets and two planets discovered by the MEarth survey, GJ 1132b and LHS 1140b. These planets are the smallest known planets that may have atmospheres amenable to detection with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). We present model thermal emission and transmission spectra for each planet, varying composition and surface pressure of the atmosphere. We base elemental compositions on those of Earth, Titan, and Venus and calculate the molecular compositions assuming chemical equilibrium, which can strongly depend on temperature. Both thermal emission and transmission spectra are sensitive to the atmospheric composition; thermal emission spectra are sensitive to surface pressure and temperature. We predict the observability of each planet’s atmosphere with JWST. GJ 1132b and TRAPPIST-1b are excellent targets for emission spectroscopy with JWST/MIRI, requiring fewer than 10 eclipse observations. Emission photometry for TRAPPIST-1c requires 5–15 eclipses; LHS 1140b and TRAPPIST-1d, TRAPPIST-1e, and TRAPPIST-1f, which could possibly have surface liquid water, may be accessible with photometry. Seven of the nine planets are strong candidates for transmission spectroscopy measurements with JWST, although the number of transits required depends strongly on the planets’ actual masses. Using the measured masses, fewer than 20 transits are required for a 5σ detection of spectral features for GJ 1132b and six of the TRAPPIST-1 planets. Dedicated campaigns to measure the atmospheres of these nine planets will allow us, for the first time, to probe formation and evolution processes of terrestrial planetary atmospheres beyond our solar system.},

	abstract = {The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will offer the first opportunity to characterize terrestrial exoplanets with sufficient precision to identify high mean molecular weight atmospheres, and TRAPPIST-1's seven known transiting Earth-sized planets are particularly favorable targets. To assist community preparations for JWST observations, we use simulations of plausible post-ocean-loss and habitable environments for the TRAPPIST-1 exoplanets, and test simulations of all bright object time-series spectroscopy modes and all Mid-Infrared Instrument photometry filters to determine optimal observing strategies for atmospheric detection and characterization using both transmission and emission observations. We find that transmission spectroscopy with the Near-Infrared Spectrograph Prism is optimal for detecting terrestrial, CO2-containing atmospheres, potentially in fewer than 10 transits for all seven TRAPPIST-1 planets, if they lack high-altitude aerosols. If the TRAPPIST-1 planets possess Venus-like H2SO4 aerosols, up to 12 times more transits may be required to detect an atmosphere. We present optimal instruments and observing modes for the detection of individual molecular species in a given terrestrial atmosphere and an observational strategy for discriminating between evolutionary states. We find that water may be prohibitively difficult to detect in both Venus-like and habitable atmospheres, due to its presence lower in the atmosphere where transmission spectra are less sensitive. Although the presence of biogenic O2 and O3 will be extremely challenging to detect, abiotically produced oxygen from past ocean loss may be detectable for all seven TRAPPIST-1 planets via O2–O2 collisionally induced absorption at 1.06 and 1.27 μm, or via NIR O3 features for the outer three planets. Our results constitute a suite of hypotheses on the nature and detectability of highly evolved terrestrial exoplanet atmospheres that may be tested with JWST.},

	abstract = {TRAPPIST-1 planets are invaluable for the study of comparative planetary science outside our solar system and possibly habitability. Both transit timing variations (TTV) of the planets and the compact, resonant architecture of the system suggest that TRAPPIST-1 planets could be endowed with various volatiles today. First, we derived from N-body simulations possible planetary evolution scenarios, and show that all the planets are likely in synchronous rotation. We then used a versatile 3D global climate model (GCM) to explore the possible climates of cool planets around cool stars, with a focus on the TRAPPIST-1 system. We investigated the conditions required for cool planets to prevent possible volatile species to be lost permanently by surface condensation, irreversible burying or photochemical destruction. We also explored the resilience of the same volatiles (when in condensed phase) to a runaway greenhouse process. We find that background atmospheres made of N{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}, CO, or O{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} are rather resistant to atmospheric collapse. However, even if TRAPPIST-1 planets were able to sustain a thick background atmosphere by surviving early X/EUV radiation and stellar wind atmospheric erosion, it is difficult for them to accumulate significant greenhouse gases like CO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}, CH{\textless}sub{\textgreater}4{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}, or NH{\textless}sub{\textgreater}3{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}. CO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} can easily condense on the permanent nightside, forming CO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} ice glaciers that would flow toward the substellar region. A complete CO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} ice surface cover is theoretically possible on TRAPPIST-1g and h only, but CO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} ices should be gravitationally unstable and get buried beneath the water ice shell in geologically short timescales. Given TRAPPIST-1 planets large EUV irradiation (at least {\textasciitilde}10{\textless}sup{\textgreater}3{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} × Titan’s flux), CH{\textless}sub{\textgreater}4{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} and NH{\textless}sub{\textgreater}3{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} are photodissociated rapidly and are thus hard to accumulate in the atmosphere. Photochemical hazes could then sedimentate and form a surface layer of tholins that would progressively thicken over the age of the TRAPPIST-1 system. Regarding habitability, we confirm that few bars of CO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} would suffice to warm the surface of TRAPPIST-1f and g above the melting point of water. We also show that TRAPPIST-1e is a remarkable candidate for surface habitability. If the planet is today synchronous and abundant in water, then it should very likely sustain surface liquid water at least in the substellar region, whatever the atmosphere considered.},

Their atmospheric regime is unknown and could range from extended primordial hydrogen-dominated to depleted atmospheres3–6. Hydrogen in particular is a powerful greenhouse gas that may prevent the habitability of inner planets while enabling the habitability of outer ones6–8. An atmosphere largely dominated by hydrogen, if cloud-free, should yield prominent spectroscopic signatures in the near-infrared detectable during transits. Observations of the innermost planets have ruled out such signatures9. However, the outermost planets are more likely to have sustained such a Neptune-like atmosphere10, 11. Here, we report observations for the four planets within or near the system’s habitable zone, the circumstellar region where liquid water could exist on a planetary surface12–14. These planets do not exhibit prominent spectroscopic signatures at near-infrared wavelengths either, which rules out cloud-free hydrogen-dominated atmospheres for TRAPPIST-1 d, e and f, with significance of 8σ, 6σ and 4σ, respectively. Such an atmosphere is instead not excluded for planet g. As high-altitude clouds and hazes are not expected in hydrogen-dominated atmospheres around planets with such insolation15, 16, these observations further support their terrestrial and potentially habitable nature.},

	abstract = {The search for water-rich Earth-sized exoplanets around low-mass stars is rapidly gaining attention because they represent the best opportunity to characterize habitable planets in the near future. Understanding the atmospheres of these planets and determining the optimal strategy for characterizing them through transmission spectroscopy with our upcoming instrumentation is essential in order to constrain their environments. For this study, we present simulated transmission spectra of tidally locked Earth-sized ocean-covered planets around late-M to mid-K stellar spectral types, utilizing the results of general circulation models previously published by Kopparapu et al. as inputs for our radiative transfer calculations performed using NASA’s Planetary Spectrum Generator (psg.gsfc.nasa.gov). We identify trends in the depth of H2O spectral features as a function of planet surface temperature and rotation rate. These trends allow us to calculate the exposure times necessary to detect water vapor in the atmospheres of aquaplanets through transmission spectroscopy with the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope as well as several future flagship space telescope concepts under consideration (the Large UV Optical Infrared Surveyor and the Origins Space Telescope) for a target list constructed from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) Input Catalog (TIC). Our calculations reveal that transmission spectra for water-rich Earth-sized planets around low-mass stars will be dominated by clouds, with spectral features {\textless}20 ppm, and only a small subset of TIC stars would allow for the characterization of an ocean planet in the habitable zone. We thus present a careful prioritization of targets that are most amenable to follow-up characterizations with next-generation instrumentation, in order to assist the community in efficiently utilizing precious telescope time.},

	abstract = {We describe how environmental context can help determine whether oxygen (O2) detected in extrasolar planetary observations is more likely to have a biological source. Here we provide an in-depth, interdisciplinary example of O2 biosignature identification and observation, which serves as the prototype for the development of a general framework for biosignature assessment. Photosynthetically generated O2 is a potentially strong biosignature, and at high abundance, it was originally thought to be an unambiguous indicator for life. However, as a biosignature, O2 faces two major challenges: (1) it was only present at high abundance for a relatively short period of Earth's history and (2) we now know of several potential planetary mechanisms that can generate abundant O2 without life being present. Consequently, our ability to interpret both the presence and absence of O2 in an exoplanetary spectrum relies on understanding the environmental context. Here we examine the coevolution of life with the early Earth's environment to identify how the interplay of sources and sinks may have suppressed O2 release into the atmosphere for several billion years, producing a false negative for biologically generated O2. These studies suggest that planetary characteristics that may enhance false negatives should be considered when selecting targets for biosignature searches. We review the most recent knowledge of false positives for O2, planetary processes that may generate abundant atmospheric O2 without a biosphere. We provide examples of how future photometric, spectroscopic, and time-dependent observations of O2 and other aspects of the planetary environment can be used to rule out false positives and thereby increase our confidence that any observed O2 is indeed a biosignature. These insights will guide and inform the development of future exoplanet characterization missions. Key Words: Biosignatures—Oxygenic photosynthesis—Exoplanets—Planetary atmospheres.

One of the most widely accepted biosignatures for an Earth-like planet is an atmosphere where oxygen is a major constituent.

Hence the spectral features of O2 and O3 alone cannot be regarded as robust signs of extraterrestrial life.},

The amount of water vapor available for photolysis in the middle atmosphere of a planet can be limited by an atmospheric cold-trap, the formation of which largely depends on the amount of noncondensable gases. We study this effect using a photochemical model coupled to a 1D radiative-convective equilibrium model in atmospheres with N2, CO2, and H2O as the main constituents. We find that in atmospheres with a low N2 inventory, water vapor mixing ratios in the middle atmosphere can be more than two orders of magnitude higher compared to atmospheres with an Earth-like N2 inventory. Without a strong surface sink, the noncondensable oxygen can build up rapidly, drying out the upper atmosphere. With a moderate surface sink, the planet can approach a steady state with significant oxygen mixing ratios in which oxygen production is balanced by surface uptake. We use a radiative transfer model to study the spectroscopic fingerprint of these atmospheres in transit observations. Spectral signatures of abiotic oxygen and ozone can be of comparable magnitude as in spectra of Earth seen as an exoplanet. Middle atmospheric water vapor is unlikely to be a usable indicator of the abiotic origin of oxygen because of the influence of oxygen on the water vapor distribution. This suggests that atmospheric oxygen and ozone cannot be used as binary bioindicators and that their interpretation will likely require atmospheric and planetary models.},

	abstract = {The search for life on exoplanets is motivated by the universal ways in which life could modify its planetary environment. Atmospheric gases such as oxygen and methane are promising candidates for such environmental modification due to the evolutionary benefits their production would confer. However, confirming that these gases are produced by life, rather than by geochemical or astrophysical processes, will require a thorough understanding of planetary context, including the expected counterfactual atmospheric evolution for lifeless planets. Here, we evaluate current understanding of planetary context for several candidate biosignatures and their upcoming observability. We review the contextual framework for oxygen and describe how conjectured abiotic oxygen scenarios may be testable. In contrast to oxygen, current understanding of how planetary context controls non-biological methane (CH4) production is limited, even though CH4 biosignatures in anoxic atmospheres may be readily detectable with the James Webb Space Telescope. We assess environmental context for CH4 biosignatures and conclude that abundant atmospheric CH4 coexisting with CO2, and CO:CH4 ≪ 1 is suggestive of biological production, although precise thresholds are dependent on stellar context and sparsely characterized abiotic CH4 scenarios. A planetary context framework is also considered for alternative or agnostic biosignatures. Whatever the distribution of life in the Universe, observations of terrestrial exoplanets in coming decades will provide a quantitative understanding of the atmospheric evolution of lifeless worlds. This knowledge will inform future instrument requirements to either corroborate the presence of life elsewhere or confirm its apparent absence.},

Considerable attention has been given to the detectability of biogenic oxygen, which could be found using an ozone proxy, but ozone detection with JWST will be extremely challenging, even for the most favorable targets. Here, we investigate the detectability of biosignatures in anoxic atmospheres analogous to those that likely existed on the early Earth. Arguably, such anoxic biosignatures could be more prevalent than oxygen biosignatures if life exists elsewhere. Specifically, we simulate JWST retrievals of TRAPPIST-1e to determine whether the methane plus carbon dioxide disequilibrium biosignature pair is detectable in transit transmission. We find that {\textasciitilde}10 transits using the Near InfraRed Spectrograph prism instrument may be sufficient to detect carbon dioxide and constrain methane abundances sufficiently well to rule out known, nonbiological CH4 production scenarios to {\textasciitilde}90\% confidence. Furthermore, it might be possible to put an upper limit on carbon monoxide abundances that would help rule out nonbiological methane-production scenarios, assuming the surface biosphere would efficiently draw down atmospheric CO. Our results are relatively insensitive to high-altitude clouds and instrument noise floor assumptions, although stellar heterogeneity and variability may present challenges.},

	abstract = {Hot Jupiters have been predicted to have a strong day/night temperature contrast and a hotspot shifted eastward of the substellar point. This was confirmed by numerous phase curve observations probing the longitudinal brightness variation of the atmosphere. Global circulation models, however, systematically underestimate the phase curve amplitude and overestimate the shift of its maximum. We use a global circulation model including non-grey radiative transfer and realistic gas and cloud opacities to systematically investigate how the atmospheric circulation of hot Jupiters varies with equilibrium temperature from 1000 to 2200 K. We show that the heat transport is very efficient for cloudless planets cooler than 1600 K and becomes less efficient at higher temperatures. When nightside clouds are present, the day-to-night heat transport becomes extremely inefficient, leading to a good match to the observed low nightside temperatures. The constancy of this low temperature is, however, due to the strong dependence of the radiative time-scale with temperature. We further show that nightside clouds increase the phase curve amplitude and decrease the phase curve offset at the same time. This change is very sensitive to the cloud chemical composition and particle size, meaning that the diversity of observed phase curves can be explained by a diversity of nightside cloud properties. Finally, we show that phase curve parameters do not necessarily track the day/night contrast nor the shift of the hotspot on isobars, and propose solutions to to recover the true hotspot shift and day/night contrast.},

With JWST’s impending launch, it is crucial that we are well prepared to understand the subtleties of terrestrial atmospheres—particularly ones that we may have not needed to consider before due to instrumentation limitations. In this work we show that patchy ice cloud variability is present in the upper atmospheres of M-dwarf terrestrial planets, particularly along the limbs. Here we test whether these variable clouds will introduce unexpected biases in the multi-epoch observations necessary to constrain atmospheric abundances. Using 3D ExoCAM general circulation models of TRAPPIST-1e, we simulate five different climates with varying pCO2 to explore the strength of this variability. These models are post-processed using NASA Goddard’s Planetary Spectrum Generator and PandExo to generate simulated observations with JWST’s NIRSpec PRISM mode at 365 different temporal outputs from each climate. Assuming the need for 10 transits of TRAPPIST-1e to detect molecular features at great confidence, we then use CHIMERA to retrieve on several randomly selected weighted averages of our simulated observations to explore the effect of multi-epoch observations with variable cloud cover along the limb on retrieved abundances. We find that the variable spectra do not affect retrieved abundances at detectable levels for our sample of TRAPPIST-1e models.},

The Planetary Spectrum Generator (PSG) can synthesize planetary spectra (atmospheres and surfaces) for a broad range of wavelengths (UV/Vis/near-IR/IR/far-IR/THz/sub-mm/Radio) from any observatory (e.g., JWST, ALMA, Keck, SOFIA), any orbiter (e.g., ExoMars, Juno), or any lander (e.g., MSL). This is achieved by combining several state-of-the-art radiative transfer models, spectroscopic databases and planetary databases (i.e., climatological and orbital). PSG has a 3D (three-dimensional) orbital calculator for most bodies in the solar system, and all confirmed exoplanets, while the radiative-transfer models can ingest billions of spectral signatures for hundreds of species from several spectroscopic repositories. It integrates the latest radiative-transfer and scattering methods in order to compute high resolution spectra via line-by-line calculations, and utilizes the efficient correlated-k method at moderate resolutions, while for computing cometary spectra, PSG handles non-LTE and LTE excitation processes. PSG includes a realistic noise calculator that integrates several telescope / instrument configurations (e.g., interferometry, coronagraphs) and detector technologies (e.g., CCD, heterodyne detectors, bolometers). Such an integration of advanced spectroscopic methods into an online tool can greatly serve the planetary community, ultimately enabling the retrieval of planetary parameters from remote sensing data, efficient mission planning strategies, interpretation of current and future planetary data, calibration of spectroscopic data, and development of new instrument/spacecraft concepts.},

	abstract = {A one-dimensional climate model is used to estimate the width of the habitable zone (HZ) around our Sun and around other main sequence stars. Our basic premise is that we are dealing with Earth-like planets with CO2/H2O/N2 atmospheres and that habitability requires the presence of liquid water on the planet's surface. The inner edge of the HZ is determined in our model by loss of water via photolysis and hydrogen escape. The outer edge of the HZ is determined by the formation of CO2 clouds, which cool a planet's surface by increasing its albedo and by lowering the convective lapse rate. Conservative estimates for these distances in our own Solar System are 0.95 and 1.37 AU, respectively; the actual width of the present HZ could be much greater. Between these two limits, climate stability is ensured by a feedback mechanism in which atmospheric CO2 concentrations vary inversely with planetary surface temperature. The width of the HZ is slightly greater for planets that are larger than Earth and for planets which have higher N2 partial pressures. The HZ evolves outward in time because the Sun increases in luminosity as it ages. A conservative estimate for the width of the 4.6-Gyr continuously habitable zone (CHZ) is 0.95 to 1.15 AU. Stars later than F0 have main sequence lifetimes exceeding 2 Gyr and, so, are also potential candidates for harboring habitable planets. The HZ around an F star is larger and occurs farther out than for our Sun; the HZ around K and M stars is smaller and occurs farther in. Nevertheless, the widths of all of these HZs are approximately the same if distance is expressed on a logarithmic scale. A log distance scale is probably the appropriate scale for this problem because the planets in our own Solar System are spaced logarithmically and because the distance at which another star would be expected to form planets should be related to the star's mass. The width of the CHZ around other stars depends on the time that a planet is required to remain habitable and on whether a planet that is initially frozen can be thawed by modest increases in stellar luminosity. For a specified period of habitability, CHZs around K and M stars are wider (in log distance) than for our Sun because these stars evolve more slowly. Planets orbiting late K stars and M stars may not be habitable, however, because they can become trapped in synchronous rotation as a consequence of tidal damping. F stars have narrower (log distance) CHZ's than our Sun because they evolve more rapidly. Our results suggest that mid-to-early K stars should be considered along with G stars as optimal candidates in the search for extraterrestrial life.},

Since M dwarf planets likely experience extreme volatile loss, the TRAPPIST-1 planets may have highly evolved, possibly uninhabitable atmospheres. We used a versatile, 1D terrestrial planet climate model with line-by-line radiative transfer and mixing length convection (VPL Climate) coupled to a terrestrial photochemistry model to simulate environmental states for the TRAPPIST-1 planets. We present equilibrium climates with self-consistent atmospheric compositions and observational discriminants of postrunaway, desiccated, 10–100 bar O2- and CO2-dominated atmospheres, including interior outgassing, as well as for water-rich compositions. Our simulations show a range of surface temperatures, most of which are not habitable, although an aqua planet TRAPPIST-1 e could maintain a temperate surface given Earth-like geological outgassing and CO2. We find that a desiccated TRAPPIST-1 h may produce habitable surface temperatures beyond the maximum greenhouse distance. Potential observational discriminants for these atmospheres in transmission and emission spectra are influenced by photochemical processes and aerosol formation and include collision-induced oxygen absorption (O2–O2), and O3, CO, SO2, H2O, and CH4 absorption features, with transit signals of up to 200 ppm. Our simulated transmission spectra are consistent with K2, Hubble Space Telescope, and Spitzer observations of the TRAPPIST-1 planets. For several terrestrial atmospheric compositions, we find that TRAPPIST-1 b is unlikely to produce aerosols. These results can inform JWST observation planning and data interpretation for the TRAPPIST-1 system and other M dwarf terrestrial planets.},

We focus on the effect of UV activity levels on detectable atmospheric features that indicate habitability on Earth, namely, H2O, O3, CH4, N2O, and CH3Cl. To observe signatures of life—O2/O3 in combination with reducing species like CH4—we find that early and active M dwarfs are the best targets of the M star grid for future telescopes. The O2 spectral feature at 0.76 μm is increasingly difficult to detect in reflected light of later M dwarfs owing to low stellar flux in that wavelength region. N2O, another biosignature detectable in the IR, builds up to observable concentrations in our planetary models around M dwarfs with low UV flux. CH3Cl could become detectable, depending on the depth of the overlapping N2O feature. We present a spectral database of Earth-like planets around cool stars for directly imaged planets as a framework for interpreting future light curves, direct imaging, and secondary eclipse measurements of the atmospheres of terrestrial planets in the habitable zone to design and assess future telescope capabilities.},

	abstract = {The TRAPPIST-1 Habitable Atmosphere Intercomparison (THAI) project was initiated to compare 3D climate models that are commonly used for predicting theoretical climates of habitable zone extrasolar planets. One of the core models studied as part of THAI is ExoCAM, an independently curated exoplanet branch of the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Community Earth System Model (CESM) version 1.2.1. ExoCAM has been used for studying atmospheres of terrestrial extrasolar planets around a variety of stars. To accompany the THAI project and provide a primary reference, here we describe ExoCAM and what makes it unique from standard configurations of CESM. Furthermore, we also conduct a series of intramodel sensitivity tests of relevant moist physical tuning parameters while using the THAI protocol as our starting point. A common criticism of 3D climate models used for exoplanet modeling is that cloud and convection routines often contain free parameters that are tuned to the modern Earth, and thus may be a source of uncertainty in evaluating exoplanet climates. Here, we explore sensitivities to numerous configuration and parameter selections, including a recently updated radiation scheme, a different cloud and convection physics package, different cloud and precipitation tuning parameters, and a different sea ice albedo. Improvements to our radiation scheme and the modification of cloud particle sizes have the largest effect on global mean temperatures, with variations up to {\textasciitilde}10 K, highlighting the requirement for accurate radiative transfer and the importance of cloud microphysics for simulating exoplanetary climates. However for the vast majority of sensitivity tests, climate differences are small. For all cases studied, intramodel differences do not bias general conclusions regarding climate states and habitability.},

Here, we use the National Center for Atmospheric Research Community Atmosphere Model version 4 to study the possible climate and habitability of the planets in the TRAPPIST-1 system. We assume the worlds are ocean-covered, with atmospheres composed of N2, CO2, and H2O, and with orbital and geophysical properties defined from observation. Model results indicate that the inner three planets (b, c, and d) presently reside interior to the inner edge of the traditional liquid water habitable zone. Thus, if water ever existed on the inner planets, they would have undergone a runaway greenhouse and lost their water to space, leaving them dry today. Conversely, the outer three planets (f, g, and h) fall beyond the maximum CO2 greenhouse outer edge of the habitable zone. Model results indicate that the outer planets cannot be warmed, despite having as much as 30 bar CO2 atmospheres, instead entering a snowball state. The middle planet (e) represents the best chance for a presently habitable ocean-covered world in the TRAPPIST-1 system. Planet e can maintain at least some habitable surface area with 0–2 bar CO2, depending on the background N2 content. Near-present-day Earth surface temperatures can be maintained for an ocean-covered planet e with either 1 bar N2 + 0.4 bar CO2, or a 1.3 bar pure CO2 atmosphere.},

	abstract = {The discovery of planets orbiting stars other than the Sun has accelerated over the past decade, and this trend will continue as new space- and ground-based observatories employ next-generation instrumentation to search the skies for habitable worlds. However, many factors and processes can affect planetary habitability and must be understood to accurately determine a planet’s habitability potential. While climate models have long been used to understand and predict climate and weather patterns on the Earth, a growing community of researchers has begun to apply these models to extrasolar planets. This work has provided a better understanding of how orbital, surface, and atmospheric properties affect planetary climate and habitability; how these climatic effects might change for different stellar and planetary environments; and how the habitability and observational signatures of newly discovered planets might be influenced by these climatic factors. This review summarizes the origins and evolution of the burgeoning field of exoplanet climatology, discusses recent work using a hierarchy of computer models to identify those planets most capable of supporting life, and offers a glimpse into future directions of this quickly evolving subfield of exoplanet science.},

Hot Jupiters that form beyond the major volatile (H2O/CO/CO2) ice lines and subsequently migrate post disk-dissipation are predicted have atmospheric carbon-to-oxygen ratios (C/O) near 1 and subsolar metallicities2, whereas planets that migrate through the disk before dissipation are predicted to be heavily polluted by infalling O-rich icy planetesimals, resulting in C/O {\textless} 0.5 and super-solar metallicities1,2. Previous observations of hot Jupiters have been able to provide bounded constraints on either H2O (refs. 3–5) or CO (refs. 6,7), but not both for the same planet, leaving uncertain4 the true elemental C and O inventory and subsequent C/O and metallicity determinations. Here we report spectroscopic observations of a typical transiting hot Jupiter, WASP-77Ab. From these, we determine the atmospheric gas volume mixing ratio constraints on both H2O and CO (9.5 × 10−5–1.5 × 10−4 and 1.2 × 10−4–2.6 × 10−4, respectively). From these bounded constraints, we are able to derive the atmospheric C/H (\$\$\{0.35\}\_\{-0.10\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.17\}\$\$ × solar) and O/H (\$\$\{0.32\}\_\{-0.08\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.12\}\$\$ × solar) abundances and the corresponding atmospheric carbon-to-oxygen ratio (C/O = 0.59 ± 0.08; the solar value is 0.55). The sub-solar (C+O)/H (\$\$\{0.33\}\_\{-0.09\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.13\}\$\$ × solar) is suggestive of a metal-depleted atmosphere relative to what is expected for Jovian-like planets1 while the near solar value of C/O rules out the disk-free migration/C-rich2 atmosphere scenario.},

	abstract = {We show that terrestrial planets in the habitable zones of M dwarfs older than ∼1 Gyr could have been in runaway greenhouses for several hundred million years following their formation due to the star's extended pre-main sequence phase, provided they form with abundant surface water. Such prolonged runaway greenhouses can lead to planetary evolution divergent from that of Earth. During this early runaway phase, photolysis of water vapor and hydrogen/oxygen escape to space can lead to the loss of several Earth oceans of water from planets throughout the habitable zone, regardless of whether the escape is energy-limited or diffusion-limited. We find that the amount of water lost scales with the planet mass, since the diffusion-limited hydrogen escape flux is proportional to the planet surface gravity. In addition to undergoing potential desiccation, planets with inefficient oxygen sinks at the surface may build up hundreds to thousands of bar of abiotically produced O2, resulting in potential false positives for life. The amount of O2 that builds up also scales with the planet mass; we find that O2 builds up at a constant rate that is controlled by diffusion: ∼5 bar/Myr on Earth-mass planets and up to ∼25 bar/Myr on super-Earths. As a result, some recently discovered super-Earths in the habitable zone such as GJ 667Cc could have built up as many as 2000 bar of O2 due to the loss of up to 10 Earth oceans of water. The fate of a given planet strongly depends on the extreme ultraviolet flux, the duration of the runaway regime, the initial water content, and the rate at which oxygen is absorbed by the surface. In general, we find that the initial phase of high luminosity may compromise the habitability of many terrestrial planets orbiting low-mass stars.

	abstract = {The James Webb Space Telescope is expected to revolutionize our understanding of Jovian worlds over the coming decade. However, as we push toward characterizing cooler, smaller, terrestrial-like planets, dedicated next-generation facilities will be required to tease out the small spectral signatures indicative of biological activity. Here, we evaluate the feasibility of determining atmospheric properties, from near-to-mid-infrared transmission spectra, of transiting temperate terrestrial M-dwarf companions. Specifically, we utilize atmospheric retrievals to explore the trade space between spectral resolution, wavelength coverage, and signal-to-noise on our ability to both detect molecular species and constrain their abundances. We find that increasing spectral resolution beyond R = 100 for near-infrared wavelengths, shorter than 5 μm, proves to reduce the degeneracy between spectral features of different molecules and thus greatly benefits the abundance constraints. However, this benefit is greatly diminished beyond 5 μm as any overlap between broad features in the mid-infrared does not deconvolve with higher resolutions. Additionally, our findings revealed that the inclusion of features beyond 11 μm did not meaningfully improve the detection significance or the abundance constraints results. We conclude that an instrument with continuous wavelength coverage from ∼2 to 11 μm, spectral resolution of R ≃ 50–300, and a 25 m2 collecting area, would be capable of detecting H2O, CO2, CH4, O3, and N2O in the atmosphere of an Earth-analog transiting a M dwarf (magK = 8.0) within 50 transits, and obtain better than an order-of-magnitude constraint on each of their abundances.},

	abstract = {The investigation of planets around other stars began with the study of gas giants, but is now extending to the discovery and characterization of super-Earths and terrestrial planets. Motivated by this observational tide, we survey the basic dynamical principles governing the atmospheric circulation of terrestrial exoplanets, and discuss the interaction of their circulation with the hydrological cycle and global-scale climate feedbacks. Terrestrial exoplanets occupy a wide range of physical and dynamical conditions, only a small fraction of which have yet been explored in detail. Our approach is to lay out the fundamental dynamical principles governing the atmospheric circulation on terrestrial planets--broadly defined--and show how they can provide a foundation for understanding the atmospheric behavior of these worlds. We first survey basic atmospheric dynamics, including the role of geostrophy, baroclinic instabilities, and jets in the strongly rotating regime (the "extratropics") and the role of the Hadley circulation, wave adjustment of the thermal structure, and the tendency toward equatorial superrotation in the slowly rotating regime (the "tropics"). We then survey key elements of the hydrological cycle, including the factors that control precipitation, humidity, and cloudiness. Next, we summarize key mechanisms by which the circulation affects the global-mean climate, and hence planetary habitability. In particular, we discuss the runaway greenhouse, transitions to snowball states, atmospheric collapse, and the links between atmospheric circulation and CO2 weathering rates. We finish by summarizing the key questions and challenges for this emerging field in the future.},

	abstract = {Next-generation space telescopes will observe the atmospheres of rocky planets orbiting nearby M-dwarfs. Understanding these observations will require well-developed theory in addition to numerical simulations. Here we present theoretical models for the temperature structure and atmospheric circulation of dry, tidally locked rocky exoplanets with gray radiative transfer and test them using a general circulation model (GCM). First, we develop a radiative-convective (RC) model that captures surface temperatures of slowly rotating and cool atmospheres. Second, we show that the atmospheric circulation acts as a global heat engine, which places strong constraints on large-scale wind speeds. Third, we develop an RC-subsiding model which extends our RC model to hot and thin atmospheres. We find that rocky planets develop large day–night temperature gradients at a ratio of wave-to-radiative timescales up to two orders of magnitude smaller than the value suggested by work on hot Jupiters. The small ratio is due to the heat engine inefficiency and asymmetry between updrafts and subsidence in convecting atmospheres. Fourth, we show, using GCM simulations, that rotation only has a strong effect on temperature structure if the atmosphere is hot or thin. Our models let us map out atmospheric scenarios for planets such as GJ 1132b, and show how thermal phase curves could constrain them. Measuring phase curves of short-period planets will require similar amounts of time on the James Webb Space Telescope as detecting molecules via transit spectroscopy, so future observations should pursue both techniques.},

The surface temperature contrast between the day and night hemispheres decreases with an increase in incident stellar flux, which is opposite the trend seen in gas giants. We define three dynamical regimes in terms of the equatorial Rossby deformation radius and the Rhines length. The slow rotation regime has a mean zonal circulation that spans from the day to the night sides, which occurs for planets around stars with effective temperatures of 3300–4500 K (rotation period days), with both the Rossby deformation radius and the Rhines length exceeding the planetary radius. Rapid rotators have a mean zonal circulation that partially spans a hemisphere and with banded cloud formation beneath the substellar point, which occurs for planets orbiting stars with effective temperatures of less than 3000 K (rotation period days), with the Rossby deformation radius less than the planetary radius. In between is the Rhines rotation regime, which retains a thermally direct circulation from the day side to the night side but also features midlatitude turbulence-driven zonal jets. Rhines rotators occur for planets around stars in the range of 3000–3300 K (rotation period ∼5–20 days), where the Rhines length is greater than the planetary radius but the Rossby deformation radius is less than the planetary radius. The dynamical state can be observationally inferred from a comparison of the morphologies of the thermal emission phase curves of synchronously rotating planets.},

	abstract = {We are on the verge of characterizing the atmospheres of terrestrial exoplanets in the habitable zones of M dwarf stars. Due to their large planet-to-star radius ratios and higher frequency of transits, terrestrial exoplanets orbiting M dwarf stars are favorable for transmission spectroscopy. In this work, we quantify the effect that water clouds have on the amplitude of water vapor transmission spectral features of terrestrial exoplanets orbiting M dwarf stars. To do so, we make synthetic transmission spectra from general circulation model (GCM) experiments of tidally locked planets. We improve upon previous work by considering how varying a broad range of planetary parameters affects transmission spectra. We find that clouds lead to a 10-100 times increase in the number of transits required to detect water features with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) with varying rotation period, incident stellar flux, surface pressure, planetary radius, and surface gravity. We also find that there is a strong increase in the dayside cloud coverage in our GCM simulations with rotation periods ≳12 days for planets with Earth’s radius. This increase in cloud coverage leads to even stronger muting of spectral features for slowly rotating exoplanets orbiting M dwarf stars. We predict that it will be extremely challenging to detect water transmission features in the atmospheres of terrestrial exoplanets in the habitable zone of M dwarf stars with JWST. However, species that are well-mixed above the cloud deck (e.g., CO2 and CH4) may still be detectable on these planets with JWST.},

The line-by-line portion of the database contains spectroscopic parameters for 39 molecules including many of their isotopologues. The format of the section of the database on individual line parameters of HITRAN has undergone the most extensive enhancement in almost two decades. It now lists the Einstein A-coefficients, statistical weights of the upper and lower levels of the transitions, a better system for the representation of quantum identifications, and enhanced referencing and uncertainty codes.

Searching for terrestrial planets in the HZ of nearby stars is the stated goal of ongoing and planned extrasolar planet surveys. Previous estimates of the inner edge of the HZ were based on one-dimensional radiative-convective models. The most serious limitation of these models is the inability to predict cloud behavior. Here we use global climate models with sophisticated cloud schemes to show that due to a stabilizing cloud feedback, tidally locked planets can be habitable at twice the stellar flux found by previous studies. This dramatically expands the HZ and roughly doubles the frequency of habitable planets orbiting red dwarf stars. At high stellar flux, strong convection produces thick water clouds near the substellar location that greatly increase the planetary albedo and reduce surface temperatures. Higher insolation produces stronger substellar convection and therefore higher albedo, making this phenomenon a stabilizing climate feedback. Substellar clouds also effectively block outgoing radiation from the surface, reducing or even completely reversing the thermal emission contrast between dayside and nightside. The presence of substellar water clouds and the resulting clement surface conditions will therefore be detectable with the James Webb Space Telescope.},

It takes a line list as an input, computes the shape of each spectral line and provides an option for grouping an enormous number of lines into a manageable number of bins. We implement a combination of Algorithm 916 and Gauss-Hermite quadrature to compute the Voigt profile, write the code in CUDA and optimise the computation for graphics processing units (GPUs). We restate the theory of the k-distribution method and use it to reduce \${\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}5\$ to \$10{\textasciicircum}8\$ lines to \${\textbackslash}sim 10\$ to \$10{\textasciicircum}4\$ wavenumber bins, which may then be used for radiative transfer, atmospheric retrieval and general circulation models. The choice of line-wing cutoff for the Voigt profile is a significant source of error and affects the value of the computed flux by \${\textbackslash}sim 10{\textbackslash}\%\$. This is an outstanding physical (rather than computational) problem, due to our incomplete knowledge of pressure broadening of spectral lines in the far line wings. We emphasize that this problem remains regardless of whether one performs line-by-line calculations or uses the k-distribution method and affects all calculations of exoplanetary atmospheres requiring the use of wavelength-dependent opacities. We elucidate the correlated-k approximation and demonstrate that it applies equally to inhomogeneous atmospheres with a single atomic/molecular species or homogeneous atmospheres with multiple species. Using a NVIDIA K20 GPU, HELIOS-K is capable of computing an opacity function with \${\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}5\$ spectral lines in \${\textbackslash}sim 1\$ second and is publicly available as part of the Exoclimes Simulation Platform (ESP; www.exoclime.org).},

In its initial version, the model atmospheres of HELIOS are one-dimensional and plane-parallel, and the equation of radiative transfer is solved in the two-stream approximation with nonisotropic scattering. A small set of the main infrared absorbers is employed, computed with the opacity calculator HELIOS-K and combined using a correlated-k approximation. The molecular abundances originate from validated analytical formulae for equilibrium chemistry. We compare HELIOS with the work of Miller-Ricci \& Fortney using a model of GJ 1214b, and perform several tests, where we find: model atmospheres with single-temperature layers struggle to converge to radiative equilibrium; k-distribution tables constructed with ≳ 0.01 cm-1 resolution in the opacity function (≲ \{10\}3 points per wavenumber bin) may result in errors ≳ 1\%-10\% in the synthetic spectra; and a diffusivity factor of 2 approximates well the exact radiative transfer solution in the limit of pure absorption. We construct “null-hypothesis” models (chemical equilibrium, radiative equilibrium, and solar elemental abundances) for six hot Jupiters. We find that the dayside emission spectra of HD 189733b and WASP-43b are consistent with the null hypothesis, while the latter consistently underpredicts the observed fluxes of WASP-8b, WASP-12b, WASP-14b, and WASP-33b. We demonstrate that our results are somewhat insensitive to the choice of stellar models (blackbody, Kurucz, or PHOENIX) and metallicity, but are strongly affected by higher carbon-to-oxygen ratios.

	abstract = {Spatial heterogeneity and temporal variability are general features in planetary weather and climate, due to the effects of planetary rotation, uneven stellar flux distribution, fluid motion instability, etc. In this study, we investigate the asymmetry and variability in the transmission spectra of 1:1 spin--orbit tidally locked (or called synchronously rotating) planets around low-mass stars. We find that for rapidly rotating planets, the transit atmospheric thickness on the evening terminator (east of the substellar region) is significantly larger than that of the morning terminator (west of the substellar region). The asymmetry is mainly related to the spatial heterogeneity in ice clouds, as the contributions of liquid clouds and water vapor are smaller. The underlying mechanism is that there are always more ice clouds on the evening terminator, due to the combined effect of coupled Rossby--Kelvin waves and equatorial superrotation that advect vapor and clouds to the east, especially at high levels of the atmosphere. For slowly rotating planets, the asymmetry reverses (the morning terminator has a larger transmission depth than the evening terminator) but the magnitude is small or even negligible. For both rapidly and slowly rotating planets, there is strong variability in the transmission spectra. The asymmetry signal is nearly impossible to be observed by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), because the magnitude of the asymmetry (about 10 ppm) is smaller than the instrumental noise and the high variability further increases the challenge.},

	abstract = {It is widely anticipated that the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be transformative for exoplanet studies. It has even been suggested that JWST could provide the first opportunity to search for biosignatures in an alien atmosphere using transmission spectroscopy. This claim is investigated, specifically for the proposed anoxic biosignature pair CH4-CO2. The most favourable known target is adopted (TRAPPIST-1e), with an assumed atmospheric composition similar to the Archean Earth. Compared to previous studies, a more systematic investigation of the effect that cloud/haze-layers have on the detectability of CH4 and CO2 is performed. In addition to a clear atmosphere scenario, cloud/haze-layers are considered at eight pressure levels between 600mbar and 1mbar. These pressures cover a plausible range for H2O cloud and photochemical haze, based on observations of solar system atmospheres and physical models of tidally-locked planets such as TRAPPIST-1e, although no assumptions regarding the cloud/haze-layer composition are made in this study. For the clear atmosphere and cloud/haze-layer pressures of 600-100mbar, strong (5-sigma) detections of both CH4 and CO2 are found to be possible with approximately 5-10 co-added transits measured using the Near Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) prism, assuming a dry stratosphere. However, approximately 30 co-added transits would be required to achieve the same result if a cloud/haze-layer is present at 10mbar. A cloud/haze-layer at 1mbar would prevent the detection of either molecule with the NIRSpec prism for observing programs up to 50 transits ({\textgreater}200 hours of JWST time), the maximum considered.},

	abstract = {The investigation of planets around other stars began with the study of gas giants, but is now extending to the discovery and characterization of super-Earths and terrestrial planets. Motivated by this observational tide, we survey the basic dynamical principles governing the atmospheric circulation of terrestrial exoplanets, and discuss the interaction of their circulation with the hydrological cycle and global-scale climate feedbacks. Terrestrial exoplanets occupy a wide range of physical and dynamical conditions, only a small fraction of which have yet been explored in detail. Our approach is to lay out the fundamental dynamical principles governing the atmospheric circulation on terrestrial planets--broadly defined--and show how they can provide a foundation for understanding the atmospheric behavior of these worlds. We first survey basic atmospheric dynamics, including the role of geostrophy, baroclinic instabilities, and jets in the strongly rotating regime (the "extratropics") and the role of the Hadley circulation, wave adjustment of the thermal structure, and the tendency toward equatorial superrotation in the slowly rotating regime (the "tropics"). We then survey key elements of the hydrological cycle, including the factors that control precipitation, humidity, and cloudiness. Next, we summarize key mechanisms by which the circulation affects the global-mean climate, and hence planetary habitability. In particular, we discuss the runaway greenhouse, transitions to snowball states, atmospheric collapse, and the links between atmospheric circulation and CO2 weathering rates. We finish by summarizing the key questions and challenges for this emerging field in the future.},

	abstract = {We explore how well spectra from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will likely constrain bulk atmospheric properties of transiting exoplanets. We start by modeling the atmospheres of archetypal hot Jupiter, warm Neptune, warm sub-Neptune, and cool super-Earth planets with atmospheres that are clear, cloudy, or of high mean molecular weight (HMMW). Next we simulate the λ = 1-11 μm transmission and emission spectra of these systems for several JWST instrument modes for single-transit or single-eclipse events. We then perform retrievals to determine how well temperatures and molecular mixing ratios (CH4, CO, CO2, H2O, NH3) can be constrained. We find that λ = 1-2.5 μm transmission spectra will often constrain the major molecular constituents of clear solar-composition atmospheres well. Cloudy or HMMW atmospheres will often require full 1-11 μm spectra for good constraints, and emission data may be more useful in cases of sufficiently high Fp and high Fp/F*. Strong temperature inversions in the solar-composition hot-Jupiter atmosphere should be detectable with 1-2.5+ μm emission spectra, and 1-5+ μm emission spectra will constrain the temperature-pressure profiles of warm planets. Transmission spectra over 1-5+ μm will constrain [Fe/H] values to better than 0.5 dex for the clear atmospheres of the hot and warm planets studied. Carbon-to-oxygen ratios can be constrained to better than a factor of 2 in some systems. We expect that these results will provide useful predictions of the scientific value of single-event JWST spectra until its on-orbit performance is known.},

Thus detectable levels of atmospheric oxygen, in combination with the existence of H2O and CO2, may not be the most promising biosignatures on planets around stars with high FUV/NUV ratios such as the observed M dwarfs.},

Since the underlying spectroscopic line lists are constantly expanding and currently include up to ∼1010–1011 transition lines, the opacity calculator codes need to become more powerful. Here we present major upgrades to the HELIOS-K GPU-accelerated opacity calculator and describe the necessary steps to process large line lists within a reasonable amount of time. Besides performance improvements, we include more capabilities and present a toolbox for handling different atomic and molecular data sets, from downloading and preprocessing the data to performing the opacity calculations in a user-friendly way. HELIOS-K supports line lists from ExoMol, HITRAN, HITEMP, NIST, Kurucz, and VALD3. By matching the resolution of 0.1 cm−1 and cutting length of 25 cm−1 used by the ExoCross code for timing performance (251 s excluding data read-in time), HELIOS-K can process the ExoMol BT2 water line list in 12.5 s. Using a resolution of 0.01 cm−1, it takes 45 s, equivalent to about 107 lines s−1. As a wavenumber resolution of 0.01 cm−1 suffices for most exoplanetary atmosphere spectroscopic calculations, we adopt this resolution in calculating opacity functions for several hundred atomic and molecular species and make them freely available on the open-access DACE database. For the opacity calculations of the database, we use a cutting length of 100 cm−1 for molecules and no cutting length for atoms. Our opacities are available for downloading from https://dace.unige.ch/opacityDatabase and may be visualized using https://dace.unige.ch/opacity.},

In particular, those HZ planets with relatively bright host stars will serve as priority targets for characterization observations, such as those involving mass determinations, transmission spectroscopy, and direct imaging. The properties of the star are greatly affected by the distance measurement to the star, and subsequent changes to the luminosity result in revisions to the extent of the HZ and the properties of the planet. This is particularly relevant in the realm of Gaia, which has released updated stellar parallaxes for the known exoplanet host stars. Here we provide a generalized formulation of the effect of distance on planetary system properties, including the HZ. We apply this methodology to three known systems and show that the recent Gaia Data Release 2 distances have a modest effect for TRAPPIST-1 but a relatively severe effect for Kepler-186 and LHS 1140.},

A key part of commissioning activities was characterizing the on-orbit performance of the observatory. Here we summarize how the performance of the spacecraft, telescope, science instruments, and ground system differ from pre-launch expectations. Almost across the board, the science performance of JWST is better than expected. In most cases, JWST will go deeper faster than expected. The telescope and instrument suite have demonstrated the sensitivity, stability, image quality, and spectral range that are necessary to transform our understanding of the cosmos through observations spanning from near-earth asteroids to the most distant galaxies.},

	abstract = {The TRAPPIST-1 system is a priority target for terrestrial exoplanet characterization. TRAPPIST-1e, residing in the habitable zone, will be observed during the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) GTO Program. Here, we assess the prospects of differentiating between prebiotic and modern Earth scenarios for TRAPPIST-1e via transmission spectroscopy. Using updated TRAPPIST-1 stellar models from the Mega-MUSCLES survey, we compute self-consistent model atmospheres for a 1 bar prebiotic Earth scenario and two modern Earth scenarios (1 and 0.5 bar eroded atmosphere). Our modern and prebiotic high-resolution transmission spectra (\$0.4{\textbackslash}!-{\textbackslash}! 20{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}rm\{{\textbackslash}mu m\}\$ at R ∼100 000) are made available online. We conduct a Bayesian atmospheric retrieval analysis to ascertain the molecular detectability, abundance measurements, and temperature constraints achievable for both scenarios with JWST. We demonstrate that JWST can differentiate between our prebiotic and modern Earth scenarios within 20 NIRSpec Prism transits via CH4 abundance measurements. However, JWST will struggle to detect O3 for our modern Earth scenario to \${\textbackslash}gt 2{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}sigma\$ confidence within the nominal mission lifetime (∼ 80 transits over 5 yr). The agnostic combination of N2O and/or O3 offers better prospects, with a predicted detection significance of \$2.7{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}sigma\$ with 100 Prism transits. We show that combining MIRI LRS transits with Prism data provides little improvement to atmospheric constraints compared to observing additional Prism transits. Though biosignatures will be challenging to detect for TRAPPIST-1e with JWST, the abundances for several important molecules – CO2, CH4, and H2O – can be measured to a precision of ≲ 0.7 dex (a factor of 5) within a 20 Prism transit JWST program.},

In a nearly circular orbit, such planets have a permanent dayside and a permanent nightside, leading to extreme heating contrasts. In this article, the atmospheric circulations forced by this heating contrast are explored, with a focus on terrestrial planets; here, “terrestrial” refers to planets with a condensed solid or liquid surface at which most of the incident stellar radiation is absorbed and does not imply habitability in the Earthlike sense. The census of exoplanets contains many terrestrial planets that are very likely to be tide locked, including extremely hot close-orbit planets around Sunlike stars and habitable zone (and hotter) planets around lower-mass stars. The circulations are discussed in terms of fluid dynamical concepts arising from study of the Earth's tropics, supplemented by general circulation model simulations. Even in the relatively simple context of dry (noncondensing) dynamics, there are a number of important unresolved issues that require further study.},

	abstract = {Abstract Equilibrium climate sensitivity of the Community Climate System Model, version 4 (CCSM4) is 3.20°C for 1° horizontal resolution in each component. This is about a half degree Celsius higher than in the previous version (CCSM3). The transient climate sensitivity of CCSM4 at 1° resolution is 1.72°C, which is about 0.2°C higher than in CCSM3. These higher climate sensitivities in CCSM4 cannot be explained by the change to a preindustrial baseline climate. This study uses the radiative kernel technique to show that, from CCSM3 to CCSM4, the global mean lapse-rate feedback declines in magnitude and the shortwave cloud feedback increases. These two warming effects are partially canceled by cooling because of slight decreases in the global mean water vapor feedback and longwave cloud feedback from CCSM3 to CCSM4. A new formulation of the mixed layer, slab-ocean model in CCSM4 attempts to reproduce the SST and sea ice climatology from an integration with a full-depth ocean, and it is integrated with a dynamic sea ice model. These new features allow an isolation of the influence of ocean dynamical changes on the climate response when comparing integrations with the slab ocean and full-depth ocean. The transient climate response of the full-depth ocean version is 0.54 of the equilibrium climate sensitivity when estimated with the new slab-ocean model version for both CCSM3 and CCSM4. The authors argue the ratio is the same in both versions because they have about the same zonal mean pattern of change in ocean surface heat flux, which broadly resembles the zonal mean pattern of net feedback strength.},

	abstract = {Previous studies have shown that sea-ice drift effectively promotes the onset of a globally ice-covered snowball climate for paleo Earth and for tidally locked planets around low-mass stars. Here, we investigate whether sea-ice drift can influence the stellar flux threshold for a snowball climate onset on rapidly rotating aqua-planets around a Sun-like star. Using a fully coupled atmosphere–land–ocean–sea-ice model and turning sea-ice drift on or off, circular orbits with no eccentricity (e = 0) and an eccentric orbit (e = 0.2) are examined. When sea-ice drift is turned off, the stellar flux threshold for the snowball onset is 1250–1275 and 1173–1199 W m−2 for e = 0 and 0.2, respectively. The difference is mainly due to the poleward retreat of sea ice and snow edges when the planet is close to the perihelion in the eccentric orbit. When sea-ice drift is turned on, the respective stellar flux threshold is 1335–1350 and 1250–1276 W m−2. This means that sea-ice drift increases the snowball onset threshold by ≈80 W m−2 for both e = 0 and 0.2, promoting the formation of a snowball climate state. We further show that oceanic dynamics have a small effect, ≤26 W m−2, on the snowball onset threshold. This is because oceanic heat transport becomes weaker and weaker as the sea-ice edge is approaching the equator. These results imply that sea-ice dynamics are important for the climate of planets close to the outer edge of the habitable zone, but oceanic heat transport is less important.},

	abstract = {TRAPPIST-1 is a fantastic nearby (∼39.14 light years) planetary system made of at least seven transiting terrestrial-size, terrestrial-mass planets all receiving a moderate amount of irradiation. To date, this is the most observationally favourable system of potentially habitable planets known to exist. Since the announcement of the discovery of the TRAPPIST-1 planetary system in 2016, a growing number of techniques and approaches have been used and proposed to characterize its true nature. Here we have compiled a state-of-the-art overview of all the observational and theoretical constraints that have been obtained so far using these techniques and approaches. The goal is to get a better understanding of whether or not TRAPPIST-1 planets can have atmospheres, and if so, what they are made of. For this, we surveyed the literature on TRAPPIST-1 about topics as broad as irradiation environment, planet formation and migration, orbital stability, effects of tides and Transit Timing Variations, transit observations, stellar contamination, density measurements, and numerical climate and escape models. Each of these topics adds a brick to our understanding of the likely—or on the contrary unlikely—atmospheres of the seven known planets of the system. We show that (i) Hubble Space Telescope transit observations, (ii) bulk density measurements comparison with H2-rich planets mass-radius relationships, (iii) atmospheric escape modelling, and (iv) gas accretion modelling altogether offer solid evidence against the presence of hydrogen-dominated—cloud-free and cloudy—atmospheres around TRAPPIST-1 planets. This means that the planets are likely to have either (i) a high molecular weight atmosphere or (ii) no atmosphere at all. There are several key challenges ahead to characterize the bulk composition(s) of the atmospheres (if present) of TRAPPIST-1 planets. The main one so far is characterizing and correcting for the effects of stellar contamination. Fortunately, a new wave of observations with the James Webb Space Telescope and near-infrared high-resolution ground-based spectrographs on existing very large and forthcoming extremely large telescopes will bring significant advances in the coming decade.},

Previous studies suggest that if these planets had surface oceans they would be in an eyeball-like climate state5–10: ice free in the vicinity of the substellar point and ice covered in the remaining regions. However, an important component of the climate system—sea-ice dynamics—has not been fully considered in previous studies. A fundamental question is whether an open ocean is stable against a globally ice-covered snowball state. Here we show that sea-ice drift cools the ocean’s surface when the ice flows towards the warmer substellar region and melts through absorbing heat from the ocean and the overlying air. As a result, the open ocean shrinks and can even disappear when atmospheric greenhouse gases are not much more abundant than on Earth, turning the planet into a snowball state. This occurs for both synchronous rotation and spin–orbit resonances (such as 3:2). These results suggest that sea-ice drift strongly reduces the open-ocean area and can significantly impact the habitability of tidally locked planets.},

Three-dimensional general circulation models (GCMs) are one of the most comprehensive tools available for this task and will be used to interpret observations of temperate rocky exoplanets. Due to parameterization choices made in GCMs, they can produce different results, even for the same planet. Employing four widely used exoplanetary GCMs-ExoCAM, LMD-G, ROCKE-3D, and the UM-we continue the TRAPPIST-1 Habitable Atmosphere Intercomparison by modeling aquaplanet climates of TRAPPIST-1e with a moist atmosphere dominated by either nitrogen or carbon dioxide. Although the GCMs disagree on the details of the simulated regimes, they all predict a temperate climate with neither of the two cases pushed out of the habitable state. Nevertheless, the intermodel spread in the global mean surface temperature is nonnegligible: 14 K and 24 K in the nitrogen- and carbon dioxide-dominated case, respectively. We find substantial intermodel differences in moist variables, with the smallest amount of clouds in LMD-Generic and the largest in ROCKE-3D. ExoCAM predicts the warmest climate for both cases and thus has the highest water vapor content and the largest amount and variability of cloud condensate. The UM tends to produce colder conditions, especially in the nitrogen-dominated case due to a strong negative cloud radiative effect on the day side of TRAPPIST-1e. Our study highlights various biases of GCMs and emphasizes the importance of not relying solely on one model to understand exoplanet climates.},

	abstract = {On water-dominated planets, warming from increased solar insolation is strongly amplified by the water vapor greenhouse feedback. As the Sun brightens due to stellar evolution, Earth will become uninhabitable due to rising temperatures. Here we use a modified version of the Community Earth System Model from the National Center for Atmospheric Research to study Earth under intense solar radiation. For small (≤10\%) increases in the solar constant (S0), Earth warms nearly linearly with climate sensitivities of 1 K/(W m−2) and global mean surface temperatures below 310 K. However, an abrupt shift in climate is found as the solar constant is increased to +12.5\% S0. Here climate sensitivity peaks at 6.5 K/(W m−2), while global mean surface temperatures rise above 330 K. This climatic transition is associated with a fundamental change to the radiative-convective state of the atmosphere. Hot, moist climates feature both strong solar absorption and inefficient radiative cooling in the low atmosphere, thus yielding net radiative heating of the near-surface layers. This heating forms an inversion that effectively shuts off convection in the boundary layer. Beyond the transition, Earth continues to warm but with climate sensitivities again near unity. Conditions conducive to significant water loss to space are not found until +19\% S0. Earth remains stable against a thermal runaway up to at least +21\% S0, but at that point, global mean surface temperatures exceed 360 K, and water loss to space becomes rapid. Water loss of the oceans from a moist greenhouse may preclude a thermal runaway.},

The effects of a different atmospheric mass on radiative forcing have been investigated in climate models of variable sophistication, but a mechanistic understanding of the thermodynamic component of the effect of atmospheric mass on early climate is missing. Using a 3-D idealized global circulation model (GCM), we systematically examine the thermodynamic effect of atmospheric mass on near-surface temperature. We find that higher atmospheric mass tends to increase the near-surface temperature mostly due to an increase in the heat capacity of the atmosphere, which decreases the net radiative cooling effect in the lower layers of the atmosphere. Additionally, the vertical advection of heat by eddies decreases with increasing atmospheric mass, resulting in further near-surface warming. As both net radiative cooling and vertical eddy heat fluxes are extratropical phenomena, higher atmospheric mass tends to flatten the meridional temperature gradient.},

Most previous studies were performed with simple 1-D radiative convective models and did not account well for the clouds and ice-albedo feedback or the atmospheric and oceanic transport of energy. We apply a global climate model (GCM) to test the different solutions to the faint young Sun problem. We explore the effect of greenhouse gases (CO2 and CH4), atmospheric pressure, cloud droplet size, land distribution, and Earth's rotation rate. We show that neglecting organic haze, 100 mbar of CO2 with 2 mbar of CH4 at 3.8 Ga and 10 mbar of CO2 with 2 mbar of CH4 at 2.5 Ga allow a temperate climate (mean surface temperature between 10°C and 20°C). Such amounts of greenhouse gases remain consistent with the geological data. Removing continents produces a warming lower than +4°C. The effect of rotation rate is even more limited. Larger droplets (radii of 17 μm versus 12 μm) and a doubling of the atmospheric pressure produce a similar warming of around +7°C. In our model, ice-free water belts can be maintained up to 25°N/S with less than 1 mbar of CO2 and no methane. An interesting cloud feedback appears above cold oceans, stopping the glaciation. Such a resistance against full glaciation tends to strongly mitigate the faint young Sun problem.},

	abstract = {Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a key chemical species that is found in a wide range of planetary atmospheres. In the context of exoplanets, CO2 is an indicator of the metal enrichment (i.e., elements heavier than helium, also called "metallicity"), and thus formation processes of the primary atmospheres of hot gas giants. It is also one of the most promising species to detect in the secondary atmospheres of terrestrial exoplanets. Previous photometric measurements of transiting planets with the Spitzer Space Telescope have given hints of the presence of CO2 but have not yielded definitive detections due to the lack of unambiguous spectroscopic identification. Here we present the detection of CO2 in the atmosphere of the gas giant exoplanet WASP-39b from transmission spectroscopy observations obtained with JWST as part of the Early Release Science Program (ERS). The data used in this study span 3.0 to 5.5 \{{\textbackslash}mu\}m in wavelength and show a prominent CO2 absorption feature at 4.3 \{{\textbackslash}mu\}m (26\{{\textbackslash}sigma\} significance). The overall spectrum is well matched by one-dimensional, 10x solar metallicity models that assume radiative-convective-thermochemical equilibrium and have moderate cloud opacity. These models predict that the atmosphere should have water, carbon monoxide, and hydrogen sulfide in addition to CO2, but little methane. Furthermore, we also tentatively detect a small absorption feature near 4.0 \{{\textbackslash}mu\}m that is not reproduced by these models.},

We measure the predicted high-amplitude H2O feature centered at 1.4 μm and the smaller amplitude features at 0.95 and 1.2 μm, with a maximum water absorption amplitude of 2.4 planetary scale heights. We incorporate these new NIR measurements into previously published observational measurements to complete the transmission spectrum from 0.3 to 5 μm. From these observed water features, combined with features in the optical and IR, we retrieve a well constrained temperature T eq = 1030\{\}-20+30 K, and atmospheric metallicity \{151\}-46+48× solar, which is relatively high with respect to the currently established mass-metallicity trends.

	abstract = {Thousands of transiting exoplanets have been discovered, but spectral analysis of their atmospheres has so far been dominated by a small number of exoplanets and data spanning relatively narrow wavelength ranges (such as 1.1-1.7 micrometres). Recent studies show that some hot-Jupiter exoplanets have much weaker water absorption features in their near-infrared spectra than predicted. The low amplitude of water signatures could be explained by very low water abundances, which may be a sign that water was depleted in the protoplanetary disk at the planet’s formation location, but it is unclear whether this level of depletion can actually occur. Alternatively, these weak signals could be the result of obscuration by clouds or hazes, as found in some optical spectra. Here we report results from a comparative study of ten hot Jupiters covering the wavelength range 0.3-5 micrometres, which allows us to resolve both the optical scattering and infrared molecular absorption spectroscopically. Our results reveal a diverse group of hot Jupiters that exhibit a continuum from clear to cloudy atmospheres. We find that the difference between the planetary radius measured at optical and infrared wavelengths is an effective metric for distinguishing different atmosphere types. The difference correlates with the spectral strength of water, so that strong water absorption lines are seen in clear-atmosphere planets and the weakest features are associated with clouds and hazes. This result strongly suggests that primordial water depletion during formation is unlikely and that clouds and hazes are the cause of weaker spectral signatures.},

	abstract = {Accurate estimations of atmospheric properties of exoplanets from transmission spectra require the understanding of degeneracies between model parameters and observations that can resolve them. We conduct a systematic investigation of such degeneracies using a combination of detailed atmospheric retrievals and a range of model assumptions, focusing on H2-rich atmospheres. As a case study, we consider the well-studied hot Jupiter HD 209458 b. We perform extensive retrievals with models ranging from simple isothermal and isobaric atmospheres to those with full pressure-temperature profiles, inhomogeneous cloud/haze coverage, multiple-molecular species, and data in the optical-infrared wavelengths. Our study reveals four key insights. First, we find that a combination of models with minimal assumptions and broadband transmission spectra with current facilities allows precise estimates of chemical abundances. In particular, high-precision optical and infrared spectra, along with models including variable cloud coverage and prominent opacity sources, with Na and K being important in the optical, provide joint constraints on cloud/haze properties and chemical abundances. Second, we show that the degeneracy between planetary radius and its reference pressure is well characterized and has little effect on abundance estimates, contrary to previous claims using semi-analytic models. Third, collision-induced absorption due to H2-H2 and H2-He interactions plays a critical role in correctly estimating atmospheric abundances. Finally, our results highlight the inadequacy of simplified semi-analytic models with isobaric assumptions for reliable retrievals of transmission spectra. Transmission spectra obtained with current facilities such as the Hubble Space Telescope and Very Large Telescope can provide strong constraints on atmospheric abundances of exoplanets.},

	abstract = {We explore how well spectra from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will likely constrain bulk atmospheric properties of transiting exoplanets. We start by modeling the atmospheres of archetypal hot Jupiter, warm Neptune, warm sub-Neptune, and cool super-Earth planets with atmospheres that are clear, cloudy, or of high mean molecular weight (HMMW). Next we simulate the λ = 1-11 μm transmission and emission spectra of these systems for several JWST instrument modes for single-transit or single-eclipse events. We then perform retrievals to determine how well temperatures and molecular mixing ratios (CH4, CO, CO2, H2O, NH3) can be constrained. We find that λ = 1-2.5 μm transmission spectra will often constrain the major molecular constituents of clear solar-composition atmospheres well. Cloudy or HMMW atmospheres will often require full 1-11 μm spectra for good constraints, and emission data may be more useful in cases of sufficiently high Fp and high Fp/F*. Strong temperature inversions in the solar-composition hot-Jupiter atmosphere should be detectable with 1-2.5+ μm emission spectra, and 1-5+ μm emission spectra will constrain the temperature-pressure profiles of warm planets. Transmission spectra over 1-5+ μm will constrain [Fe/H] values to better than 0.5 dex for the clear atmospheres of the hot and warm planets studied. Carbon-to-oxygen ratios can be constrained to better than a factor of 2 in some systems. We expect that these results will provide useful predictions of the scientific value of single-event JWST spectra until its on-orbit performance is known.},

	abstract = {We present a new method to retrieve molecular abundances and temperature profiles from exoplanet atmosphere photometry and spectroscopy. We run millions of one-dimensional (1D) atmosphere models in order to cover the large range of allowed parameter space. In order to run such a large number of models, we have developed a parametric pressure-temperature (P-T) profile coupled with line-by-line radiative transfer, hydrostatic equilibrium, and energy balance, along with prescriptions for non-equilibrium molecular composition and energy redistribution. The major difference from traditional 1D radiative transfer models is the parametric P-T profile, which essentially means adopting energy balance only at the top of the atmosphere and not in each layer. We see the parametric P-T model as a parallel approach to the traditional exoplanet atmosphere models that rely on several free parameters to encompass unknown absorbers and energy redistribution. The parametric P-T profile captures the basic physical features of temperature structures in planetary atmospheres (including temperature inversions), and fits a wide range of published P-T profiles, including those of solar system planets. We apply our temperature and abundance retrieval method to the atmospheres of two transiting exoplanets, HD 189733b and HD 209458b, which have the best Spitzer and Hubble Space Telescope data available. For HD 189733b, we find efficient day-night redistribution of energy in the atmosphere, and molecular abundance constraints confirming the presence of H2O, CO, CH4, and CO2. For HD 209458b, we confirm and constrain the dayside thermal inversion in an average 1D temperature profile. We also report independent detections of H2O, CO, CH4, and CO2 on the dayside of HD 209458b, based on six-channel Spitzer photometry. We report constraints for HD 189733b due to individual data sets separately; a few key observations are variable in different data sets at similar wavelengths. Moreover, a noticeably strong CO2 absorption in one data set is significantly weaker in another. We must, therefore, acknowledge the strong possibility that the atmosphere is variable, both in its energy redistribution state and in the chemical abundances.},

The broad wavelength coverage and high sensitivity of its instruments will allow us to extract far more information from exoplanet spectra than what has been possible with current observations. In this paper, we investigate whether current retrieval methods will still be valid in the era of JWST, exploring common approximations used when retrieving transmission spectra of hot Jupiters. To assess biases, we use 1D photochemical models to simulate typical hot Jupiter cloud-free atmospheres and generate synthetic observations for a range of carbon-to-oxygen ratios. Then, we retrieve these spectra using TauREx, a Bayesian retrieval tool, using two methodologies: one assuming an isothermal atmosphere, and one assuming a parameterized temperature profile. Both methods assume constant-with-altitude abundances. We found that the isothermal approximation biases the retrieved parameters considerably, overestimating the abundances by about one order of magnitude. The retrieved abundances using the parameterized profile are usually within 1σ of the true state, and we found the retrieved uncertainties to be generally larger compared to the isothermal approximation. Interestingly, we found that by using the parameterized temperature profile we could place tight constraints on the temperature structure. This opens the possibility of characterizing the temperature profile of the terminator region of hot Jupiters. Lastly, we found that assuming a constant-with-altitude mixing ratio profile is a good approximation for most of the atmospheres under study.},

	abstract = {We present a modular, extensible likelihood framework for spectroscopic inference based on synthetic model spectra. The subtraction of an imperfect model from a continuously sampled spectrum introduces covariance between adjacent datapoints (pixels) into the residual spectrum. For the high signal-to-noise data with large spectral range that is commonly employed in stellar astrophysics, that covariant structure can lead to dramatically underestimated parameter uncertainties (and, in some cases, biases). We construct a likelihood function that accounts for the structure of the covariance matrix, utilizing the machinery of Gaussian process kernels. This framework specifically addresses the common problem of mismatches in model spectral line strengths (with respect to data) due to intrinsic model imperfections (e.g., in the atomic/molecular databases or opacity prescriptions) by developing a novel local covariance kernel formalism that identifies and self-consistently downweights pathological spectral line “outliers.” By fitting many spectra in a hierarchical manner, these local kernels provide a mechanism to learn about and build data-driven corrections to synthetic spectral libraries. An open-source software implementation of this approach is available at http://iancze.github.io/Starfish, including a sophisticated probabilistic scheme for spectral interpolation when using model libraries that are sparsely sampled in the stellar parameters. We demonstrate some salient features of the framework by fitting the high-resolution V-band spectrum of WASP-14, an F5 dwarf with a transiting exoplanet, and the moderate-resolution K-band spectrum of Gliese 51, an M5 field dwarf.},

Late-T dwarf spectra are particularly diagnostic, due to their relatively cloud-free atmospheres and deep molecular bands. With the use of powerful atmospheric retrieval tools applied to the spectra of these objects, direct constraints on molecular/atomic abundances, gravity, and vertical thermal profiles can be obtained, enabling a broad exploration of the chemical/physical mechanisms operating in their atmospheres. We present a uniform retrieval analysis on low-resolution Infrared Telescope Facility SpeX near-infrared spectra for a sample of 50 T dwarfs, including new observations as part of a recent volume-limited survey. This analysis more than quadruples the sample of T dwarfs with retrieved temperature profiles and abundances (H2O, CH4, NH3, K, and subsequent C/O and metallicities). We are generally able to constrain the effective temperatures to within 50 K, the volume mixing ratios for major species to within 0.25 dex, the atmospheric metallicities [M/H] to within 0.2, and the C/O ratios to within 0.2. We compare our retrieved constraints on the thermal structures, chemistry, and gravities of these objects with predictions from self-consistent radiative-convective equilibrium models and find, in general, though with substantial scatter, consistency with solar composition chemistry and the thermal profiles of the neighboring stellar FGK population. Objects with notable discrepancies between the two modeling techniques and potential mechanisms for their differences, be they related to the modeling approach or physically motivated, are discussed more thoroughly in the text.},

A Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis shows that the most likely model parameters are consistent with a low-temperature, low-gravity photosphere with significant extinction and no more than modest continuum veiling. Its T eff ≃ 3260 K effective temperature is similar to that of older, more evolved pre-main-sequence stars, but its surface gravity log g ≃ 2.4 cm s-2 is approximately 1 dex lower. This implies that the radius of this protostar is a factor of ∼3 larger than that of 106 year old T Tauri stars. Its low veiling is consistent with a circumstellar disk having intrinsic near-IR emission that is less than or equal to that of more evolved Class I protostars. Along with the high extinction, this suggests that most of the circumstellar material is in a cold envelope, as expected for a Class 0 protostar. This is the first known detection and analysis of a Class 0 protostar absorption spectrum.},

We combine five secondary eclipses of the hot Jupiter WASP-18b (Tday ∼ 2900 K) that we secured between 1.1 and 1.7 μm with the Wide Field Camera 3 instrument on board the Hubble Space Telescope. Our extracted spectrum (S/N = 50, R ∼ 40) does not exhibit clearly identifiable molecular features but is poorly matched by a blackbody spectrum. We complement this data with previously published Spitzer/Infrared Array Camera observations of this target and interpret the combined spectrum by computing a grid of self-consistent, 1D forward models, varying the composition and energy budget. At these high temperatures, we find there are important contributions to the overall opacity from H− ions, as well as the removal of major molecules by thermal dissociation (including water), and thermal ionization of metals. These effects were omitted in previous spectral retrievals for very hot gas giants, and we argue that they must be included to properly interpret the spectra of these objects. We infer a new metallicity and C/O ratio for WASP-18b, and find them well constrained to be solar ([M/H] = −0.01 ± 0.35, C/O {\textless} 0.85 at 3σ confidence level), unlike previous work but in line with expectations for giant planets. The best-fitting self-consistent temperature–pressure profiles are inverted, resulting in an emission feature at 4.5 μm seen in the Spitzer photometry. These results further strengthen the evidence that the family of very hot gas giant exoplanets commonly exhibit thermal inversions.},

The grid can be applied to current and future observations to characterize exoplanet atmospheres and serves as a reference to interpret atmospheric retrieval analysis results. To build the grid, we developed a one-dimensional code for calculating the atmospheric thermal structure and linked it to a photochemical model that includes disequilibrium chemistry (molecular diffusion, vertical mixing, and photochemistry). We compare the thermal proﬁles and atmospheric composition of planets at different semimajor axes (0.01 AU a 0.1 AU) orbiting F, G, K, and M stars. Temperature and UV ﬂux affect chemical species in the atmosphere. We explore which effects are due to temperature and which are due to stellar characteristics, showing the species most affected in each case. CH4 and H2O are the most sensitive to UV ﬂux, H displaces H2 as the most abundant gas in the upper atmosphere for planets receiving a high UV ﬂux. CH4 is more abundant for cooler planets. We explore vertical mixing, to inform degeneracies on our models and in the resulting spectral observables. For lower pressures, observable species like H2O or CO2 can indicate the efﬁciency of vertical mixing, with larger mixing ratios for a stronger mixing. By establishing the grid, testing the sensitivity of the results, and comparing our model to published results, our paper provides a tool to estimate what observations could yield. We apply our model to WASP-12b, CoRoT-2b, XO-1b, HD189733b, and HD97658b.},

	abstract = {Simulated exoplanet transmission spectra are critical for planning and interpretation of observations and to explore the sensitivity of spectral features to atmospheric thermochemical processes. We present a publicly available generic model grid of planetary transmission spectra, scalable to a wide range of H2/He dominated atmospheres. The grid is computed using the 1D/2D atmosphere model ATMO for two different chemical scenarios, first considering local condensation only, secondly considering global condensation and removal of species from the atmospheric column (rainout). The entire grid consists of 56 320 model simulations across 22 equilibrium temperatures (400–2600 K), four planetary gravities (5–50 ms−2), five atmospheric metallicities (1x–200x), four C/O ratios (0.35–1.0), four scattering haze parameters, four uniform cloud parameters, and two chemical scenarios. We derive scaling equations which can be used with this grid, for a wide range of planet–star combinations. We validate this grid by comparing it with other model transmission spectra available in the literature. We highlight some of the important findings, such as the rise of SO2 features at 100x solar metallicity, differences in spectral features at high C/O ratios between two condensation approaches, the importance of VO features without TiO to constrain the limb temperature and features of TiO/VO both, to constrain the condensation processes. Finally, this generic grid can be used to plan future observations using the HST, VLT, JWST, and various other telescopes. The fine variation of parameters in the grid also allows it to be incorporated in a retrieval framework, with various machine learning techniques.},

However, a modeling framework must be developed to deliver accurate inferences of atmospheric properties for these complex data sets. Here, we develop an approach to retrieve temperature structures and molecular abundances from phase curve spectra at any orbital phase. In the context of a representative hot Jupiter with a large day–night temperature contrast, we examine the biases in typical one-dimensional (1D) retrievals as a function of orbital phase/geometry, compared to two-dimensional (2D) models that appropriately capture the disk-integrated phase geometry. We guide our intuition by applying our new framework on a simulated Hubble Space Telescope (HST)+Spitzer phase curve data set in which the “truth” is known, followed by an application to the spectroscopic phase curve of the canonical hot Jupiter, WASP-43b. We also demonstrate the retrieval framework on simulated James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) phase curve observations. We apply our new geometric framework to a joint fit of all spectroscopic phases, assuming longitudinal molecular abundance homogeneity, resulting in an a factor of 2 improvement in abundances precision when compared to individual phase constraints. With a 1D retrieval model on simulated HST+Spitzer data, we find strongly biased molecular abundances for CH4 and CO2 at most orbital phases. With 2D, the day and night profiles retrieved from WASP-43b remain consistent throughout the orbit. JWST retrievals show that a 2D model is strongly favored at all orbital phases. Based on our new 2D retrieval implementation, we provide recommendations on when 1D models are appropriate and when more complex phase geometries involving multiple TP profiles are required to obtain an unbiased view of tidally locked planetary atmospheres.},

They span a range of low masses and temperatures relative to solar-type stars, facilitating molecule formation throughout their atmospheres. Standard stellar atmosphere models primarily designed for FGK stars face challenges when characterizing broadband molecular features in spectra of cool stars. Here, we introduce SPHINX--a new 1-D self-consistent radiative-convective thermochemical equilibrium chemistry model grid of atmospheres and spectra for M dwarfs in low-resolution (R{\textasciitilde}250). We incorporate the latest pre-computed absorption cross-sections with pressure-broadening for key molecules dominant in late-K, early/main-sequence-M stars. We then validate our grid models by acquiring fundamental properties (Teff, log(g), [M/H], radius, and C/O) for 10 benchmark M+G binary stars with known host metallicities and 10 M dwarfs with interferometrically measured angular diameters. Incorporating a Gaussian-process inference tool Starfish, we account for correlated and systematic noise in low-resolution (spectral stitching of SpeX, SNIFS, and STIS) observations and derive robust estimates of fundamental M dwarf atmospheric parameters. Additionally, we assess the influence of photospheric heterogeneity on acquired [M/H] and find that it could explain some deviations from observations. We also probe whether the model-assumed convective mixing-length parameter influences inferred radii, effective temperature, and [M/H] and again find that may explain discrepancies between interferometry observations and model-derived stellar parameters for cooler M dwarfs. Mainly, we show the unique strength in leveraging broadband molecular absorption features occurring in low-resolution M dwarf spectra and demonstrate the ability to improve constraints on fundamental properties of exoplanet hosts and late brown dwarf companions.},

	abstract = {Cloud cover at the planetary limb of water-rich Earth-like planets is likely to weaken chemical signatures in transmission spectra, impeding attempts to characterize these atmospheres. However, based on observations of Earth and solar system worlds, exoplanets with atmospheres should have both short-term weather and long-term climate variability, implying that cloud cover may be less during some observing periods. We identify and describe a mechanism driving periodic clear sky events at the terminators in simulations of tidally locked Earth-like planets. A feedback between dayside cloud radiative effects, incoming stellar radiation and heating, and the dynamical state of the atmosphere, especially the zonal wavenumber-1 Rossby wave identified in past work on tidally locked planets, leads to oscillations in Rossby wave phase speeds and in the position of Rossby gyres and results in advection of clouds to or away from the planet's eastern terminator. We study this oscillation in simulations of Proxima Centauri b, TRAPPIST 1-e, and rapidly rotating versions of these worlds located at the extreme inner edge of their stars' habitable zones. We simulate time series of the transit depths of the 1.4 \{{\textbackslash}mu\}m water feature and 2.7 \{{\textbackslash}mu\}m carbon dioxide feature. The impact of atmospheric variability on the transmission spectra is sensitive to the structure of the dayside cloud cover and the location of the Rossby gyres, but none of our simulations have variability significant enough to be detectable with current methods.},

In our simulations, the LASO has a vertical extent of 35–55 km, a period of 5–6.5 months, and a peak-to-peak wind speed amplitude of −70 to +130 m s−1 with a maximum at an altitude of 41 km. Unlike the QBO, the LASO displays longitudinal asymmetries related to the asymmetric thermal forcing of the planet and to interactions with the resulting stationary Rossby waves. The equatorial gravity wave sources driving the LASO are localized in the deep convection region at the substellar point and in a jet exit region near the western terminator, unlike the QBO, for which these sources are distributed uniformly around the planet. Longitudinally, the western terminator experiences the highest wind speeds and undergoes reversals earlier than other longitudes. The antistellar point only experiences a weak oscillation with a very brief, low-speed westward phase. The QBO on Earth is associated with fluctuations in the abundances of water vapor and trace gases such as ozone, which are also likely to occur on exoplanets if these gases are present. Strong fluctuations in temperature and the abundances of atmospheric species at the terminators will need to be considered when interpreting atmospheric observations of tidally locked exoplanets.},

Aerosols significantly mute molecular features in transit spectra because they prevent light from probing the deeper layers of the atmosphere. Earth occasionally has stratospheric/high tropospheric clouds at 15–20 km that could substantially limit the observable depth of the underlying atmosphere. We use solar occultations of Earth’s atmosphere to create synthetic JWST transit spectra of Earth analogues orbiting dwarf stars. Unlike previous investigations, we consider both clear and cloudy sightlines from the SCISAT satellite. We find that the maximum difference in effective thickness of the atmosphere between a clear and globally cloudy atmosphere is 8.5 km at 2.28  \${\textbackslash}mu\$m, with a resolution of 0.02 \${\textbackslash}mu\$m. After incorporating the effects of refraction and Pandexo’s noise modelling, we find that JWST would not be able to detect Earth-like stratospheric clouds if an exo-Earth was present in the TRAPPIST-1 system, as the cloud spectrum differs from the clear spectrum by a maximum of 10 ppm. These stratospheric clouds are also not robustly detected by TauREx when performing spectral retrieval for a cloudy TRAPPIST-1 planet. However, if an Earth-sized planet were to orbit in a white dwarf’s habitable zone, then we predict that JWST’s NIRSpec would be able to detect its stratospheric clouds after only four transits. We conclude that stratospheric clouds would not impede JWST transit spectroscopy or the detection of biosignatures for Earth-like atmospheres.},

	abstract = {Identifying terrestrial planets in the habitable zones (HZs) of other stars is one of the primary goals of ongoing radial velocity (RV) and transit exoplanet surveys and proposed future space missions. Most current estimates of the boundaries of the HZ are based on one-dimensional (1D), cloud-free, climate model calculations by Kasting et al. However, this model used band models that were based on older HITRAN and HITEMP line-by-line databases. The inner edge of the HZ in the Kasting et al. model was determined by loss of water, and the outer edge was determined by the maximum greenhouse provided by a CO2 atmosphere. A conservative estimate for the width of the HZ from this model in our solar system is 0.95–1.67 AU. Here an updated 1D radiative–convective, cloud-free climate model is used to obtain new estimates for HZ widths around F, G, K, and M stars. New H2O and CO2 absorption coefficients, derived from the HITRAN 2008 and HITEMP 2010 line-by-line databases, are important improvements to the climate model. According to the new model, the water-loss (inner HZ) and maximum greenhouse (outer HZ) limits for our solar system are at 0.99 and 1.70 AU, respectively, suggesting that the present Earth lies near the inner edge. Additional calculations are performed for stars with effective temperatures between 2600 and 7200 K, and the results are presented in parametric form, making them easy to apply to actual stars. The new model indicates that, near the inner edge of the HZ, there is no clear distinction between runaway greenhouse and water-loss limits for stars with Teff ≲ 5000 K, which has implications for ongoing planet searches around K and M stars. To assess the potential habitability of extrasolar terrestrial planets, we propose using stellar flux incident on a planet rather than equilibrium temperature. This removes the dependence on planetary (Bond) albedo, which varies depending on the host star's spectral type. We suggest that conservative estimates of the HZ (water-loss and maximum greenhouse limits) should be used for current RV surveys and Kepler mission to obtain a lower limit on η⊕, so that future flagship missions like TPF-C and Darwin are not undersized. Our model does not include the radiative effects of clouds; thus, the actual HZ boundaries may extend further in both directions than the estimates just given.},

	abstract = {Rocky exoplanets orbiting in the habitable zone (HZ) of nearby M dwarfs provide unique opportunities for characterizing their atmospheres and searching for biosignature gases. TRAPPIST-1e, a temperate Earth-sized exoplanet in the HZ of a nearby M dwarf, is arguably the most favourable target for ground- and space-based atmospheric characterization by the extremely large telescopes (ELTs) and the James Webb Space Telescope. To inform future observations in reflected and emitted lights using these upcoming telescopes, we simulate the high-resolution reflection and emission spectra for TRAPPIST-1e for both modern and prebiotic Earth-like atmospheric compositions. To demonstrate the effects of wavelength-dependent albedo on climate and spectra, we further simulate five albedo scenarios for each atmospheric composition: cloudy modern Earth-like, cloud-free modern Earth-like, cloudy ocean planet, 100 per cent cloudy planet, and wavelength-independent albedo of 0.31. We use the recent Mega-MUSCLES spectral energy distribution of TRAPPIST-1 for our models. We show that the O2 + CH4 and O3 + CH4 biosignature pairs as well as climate indicators (CO2 and H2O) show features in both high-resolution reflection and emission spectra of TRAPPIST-1e that the ELTs can search for. Our high-resolution data base for modern and prebiotic Earth TRAPPIST-1e models with various surface compositions and cloud distributions provides a tool for observers to train retrieval algorithms and plan observation strategies to characterize this potentially habitable world.},

	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2208.11692},
	abstract = {Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a key chemical species that is found in a wide range of planetary atmospheres. In the context of exoplanets, CO2 is an indicator of the metal enrichment (i.e., elements heavier than helium, also called "metallicity"), and thus formation processes of the primary atmospheres of hot gas giants. It is also one of the most promising species to detect in the secondary atmospheres of terrestrial exoplanets. Previous photometric measurements of transiting planets with the Spitzer Space Telescope have given hints of the presence of CO2 but have not yielded definitive detections due to the lack of unambiguous spectroscopic identification. Here we present the detection of CO2 in the atmosphere of the gas giant exoplanet WASP-39b from transmission spectroscopy observations obtained with JWST as part of the Early Release Science Program (ERS). The data used in this study span 3.0 to 5.5 \{{\textbackslash}mu\}m in wavelength and show a prominent CO2 absorption feature at 4.3 \{{\textbackslash}mu\}m (26\{{\textbackslash}sigma\} significance). The overall spectrum is well matched by one-dimensional, 10x solar metallicity models that assume radiative-convective-thermochemical equilibrium and have moderate cloud opacity. These models predict that the atmosphere should have water, carbon monoxide, and hydrogen sulfide in addition to CO2, but little methane. Furthermore, we also tentatively detect a small absorption feature near 4.0 \{{\textbackslash}mu\}m that is not reproduced by these models.},

	abstract = {We model the impact of nonuniform cloud cover on transit transmission spectra. Patchy clouds exist in nearly every solar system atmosphere, brown dwarfs, and transiting exoplanets. Our major findings suggest that fractional cloud coverage can exactly mimic high mean molecular weight atmospheres and vice versa over certain wavelength regions, in particular, over the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) bandpass (1.1–1.7 μm). We also find that patchy cloud coverage exhibits a signature that is different from uniform global clouds. Furthermore, we explain analytically why the “patchy cloud-high mean molecular weight” degeneracy exists. We also explore the degeneracy of nonuniform cloud coverage in atmospheric retrievals on both synthetic and real planets. We find from retrievals on a synthetic solar composition hot Jupiter with patchy clouds and a cloud-free high mean molecular weight warm Neptune that both cloud-free high mean molecular weight atmospheres and partially cloudy atmospheres can explain the data equally well. Another key finding is that the HST WFC3 transit transmission spectra of two well-observed objects, the hot Jupiter HD 189733b and the warm Neptune HAT-P-11b, can be explained well by solar composition atmospheres with patchy clouds without the need to invoke high mean molecular weight or global clouds. The degeneracy between high molecular weight and solar composition partially cloudy atmospheres can be broken by observing the molecular Rayleigh scattering differences between the two. Furthermore, the signature of partially cloudy limbs also appears as a ∼100 ppm residual in the ingress and egress of the transit light curves, provided that the transit timing is known to seconds.},

	abstract = {I calculate the physical properties of 32 transiting extrasolar planet and brown-dwarf systems from existing photometric observations and measured spectroscopic parameters. The systems studied include 15 observed by the CoRoT satellite, 10 by Kepler and five by the Deep Impact spacecraft. Inclusion of the objects studied in previous papers leads to a sample of 58 transiting systems with homogeneously measured properties. The Kepler data include observations from Quarter 2, and my analyses of several of the systems are the first to be based on short-cadence data from this satellite. The light curves are modelled using the JKTEBOP code, with attention paid to the treatment of limb darkening, contaminating light, orbital eccentricity, correlated noise and numerical integration over long exposure times. The physical properties are derived from the light-curve parameters, spectroscopic characteristics of the host star and constraints from five sets of theoretical stellar model predictions. An alternative approach using a calibration from eclipsing binary star systems is explored and found to give comparable results whilst imposing a much smaller computational burden. My results are in good agreement with published properties for most of the transiting systems, but discrepancies are identified for CoRoT-5, CoRoT-8, CoRoT-13, Kepler-5 and Kepler-7. Many of the error bars quoted in the literature are underestimated. Refined orbital ephemerides are given for CoRoT-8 and for the Kepler planets. Asteroseismic constraints on the density of the host stars are in good agreement with the photometric equivalents for HD 17156 and TrES-2, but not for HAT-P-7 and HAT-P-11. Complete error budgets are generated for each transiting system, allowing identification of the observations best-suited to improve measurements of their physical properties. Whilst most systems would benefit from further photometry and spectroscopy, HD 17156, HD 80606, HAT-P-7 and TrES-2 are now extremely well characterized. HAT-P-11 is an exceptional candidate for studying starspots. The orbital ephemerides of some transiting systems are becoming uncertain and they should be re-observed in the near future. The primary results from the current work and from previous papers in the series have been placed in an online catalogue, from where they can be obtained in a range of formats for reference and further study.

	abstract = {Transmission spectroscopy is one of the premier methods used to probe the temperature, composition, and cloud properties of exoplanet atmospheres. Recent studies have demonstrated that the multidimensional nature of exoplanet atmospheres—due to nonuniformities across the day–night transition and between the morning and evening terminators—can strongly influence transmission spectra. However, the computational demands of 3D radiative-transfer techniques have precluded their usage within atmospheric retrievals. Here we introduce TRIDENT, a new 3D radiative-transfer model which rapidly computes transmission spectra of exoplanet atmospheres with day–night, morning–evening, and vertical variations in temperature, chemical abundances, and cloud properties. We also derive a general equation for transmission spectra, accounting for 3D atmospheres, refraction, multiple scattering, ingress/egress, grazing transits, stellar heterogeneities, and nightside thermal emission. After introducing TRIDENT’s linear-algebra-based approach to 3D radiative transfer, we propose new parametric prescriptions for 3D temperature and abundance profiles and 3D clouds. We show that multidimensional transmission spectra exhibit two significant observational signatures: (i) day–night composition gradients alter the relative amplitudes of absorption features; and (ii) morning–evening composition gradients distort the peak-to-wing contrast of absorption features. Finally, we demonstrate that these signatures of multidimensional atmospheres incur residuals {\textgreater}100 ppm compared to 1D models, rendering them potentially detectable with the James Webb Space Telescope. TRIDENT’s rapid radiative transfer, coupled with parametric multidimensional atmospheres, unlocks the final barrier to 3D atmospheric retrievals.},

The algorithm relies on the method of Bayesian inference, which for the first time directly integrates the spectroscopic analysis pipeline based on the global spectrum synthesis and allows for comprehensive and objective error calculations given the priors. Arbitrary input data sets can be included into our analysis and other stellar quantities, in addition to stellar age, effective temperature, surface gravity, and metallicity, can be computed on demand. We lay out the mathematical framework of the method and apply it to several observational data sets, including high- and low-resolution spectra (UVES, NARVAL, HARPS, SDSS/SEGUE). We find that simpler approximations for the spectroscopic probability distribution function, which are inherent to past Bayesian approaches, lead to deviations of several standard deviations and unreliable errors on the same data. By its flexibility and the simultaneous analysis of multiple independent measurements for a star, it will be ideal to analyse and cross-calibrate the large ongoing and forthcoming surveys, like Gaia-European Southern Observatory (ESO), SDSS, Gaia and LSST.},

Here we report preliminary findings for the instrument performance from the team's MIRI Working Group. Overall we find that MIRI's performance for phase curve observations is excellent, with a few minor caveats. The key takeaways for Cycle 2 planning with MIRI/LRS are: (1) long-duration observations ({\textgreater} 24 hours) have now been successfully executed; (2) for phase curves, we recommend including a one-hour burn-in period prior to taking science data to mitigate the effects of the ramp systematic; and (3) we do not yet recommend partial phase curve observations. In addition, we also find that: the position of the spectrum on the detector is stable to within 0.03 pixels over the full 26.5-hour observation; the light curves typically show a systematic downward ramp that is strongest for the first 30 minutes, but continues to decay for hours; from 10.6-11.8 microns, the ramp effect has remarkably different behavior, possibly due to a different illumination history for the affected region of the detector; after trimming the integrations most affected by the initial ramps and correcting the remaining systematics with analytic models, we obtain residuals to the light-curve fits that are typically within 25\% of the photon noise limit for 0.5-micron spectroscopic bins; non-linearity correction is not a significant source of additional noise for WASP-43, though it may be an issue for brighter targets; the gain value of 5.5 electrons/DN currently on CRDS and JDox is known to be incorrect, and the current best estimate for the gain is approximately 3.1 electrons/DN; new reference files for the JWST calibration pipeline reflecting these findings are under development at STScI.},

We use the first JWST transmission spectrum of the hot Saturn-mass exoplanet, WASP-39 b, obtained with the NIRSpec instrument in the 3-5 \${\textbackslash}mu\$m range to investigate (a) what atmospheric constraints are possible with JWST-quality data in this spectral range, (b) requirements for atmospheric models used in retrievals, (c) effect of differences between data reduction pipelines on retrieved atmospheric properties, and (d) complementarity between JWST data in the 3-5 \${\textbackslash}mu\$m range and HST observations at shorter wavelengths. JWST spectra in the 3-5 \${\textbackslash}mu\$m range provide a promising avenue for chemical detections while encompassing a window in cloud opacity for several prominent aerosols. We confirm recent inferences of CO\$\_2\$, SO\$\_2\$, H\$\_2\$O, and CO in WASP-39 b, report tentative evidence for H\$\_2\$S, and retrieve elemental abundances consistent with Saturn's metallicity. We retrieve molecular abundances with \${\textbackslash}sim\$0.3-0.6 dex precision with this relatively limited spectral range. When considering the 3-5 \${\textbackslash}mu\$m data alone, reported differences in spectra with different reduction pipelines can affect abundance estimates by up to \${\textbackslash}sim\$1 dex and the detectability of less prominent species. Complementing with data at shorter wavelengths, e.g. with other JWST instruments or HST WFC3 (\${\textbackslash}sim\$0.8-1.7 \${\textbackslash}mu\$m), can significantly improve the accuracy and precision of the abundance estimates. The high data quality enables constraints on aerosol properties, including their composition, modal size and extent, motivating their consideration in retrievals.

All retrieval models attempt to extract the maximum amount of atmospheric information from finite sets of data, but while the problem to be solved is fundamentally the same for any planetary atmosphere, until now all such models have been assembled ad hoc to address data from individual missions. In this paper, we describe a new general-purpose retrieval model, Non-linear Optimal Estimator for MultivariatE Spectral analySIS (NEMESIS), which was originally developed to interpret observations of Saturn and Titan from the composite infrared spectrometer on board the NASA Cassini spacecraft. NEMESIS has been constructed to be generally applicable to any planetary atmosphere and can be applied from the visible/near-infrared right out to microwave wavelengths, modelling both reflected sunlight and thermal emission in either scattering or non-scattering conditions. NEMESIS has now been successfully applied to the analysis of data from many planetary missions and also ground-based observations.},

	abstract = {Over a large range of equilibrium temperatures, clouds shape the transmission spectrum of hot Jupiter atmospheres, yet their composition remains unknown. Recent observations show that the Kepler light curves of some hot Jupiters are asymmetric: for the hottest planets, the light curve peaks before secondary eclipse, whereas for planets cooler than ∼1900 K, it peaks after secondary eclipse. We use the thermal structure from 3D global circulation models to determine the expected cloud distribution and Kepler light curves of hot Jupiters. We demonstrate that the change from an optical light curve dominated by thermal emission to one dominated by scattering (reflection) naturally explains the observed trend from negative to positive offset. For the cool planets the presence of an asymmetry in the Kepler light curve is a telltale sign of the cloud composition, because each cloud species can produce an offset only over a narrow range of effective temperatures. By comparing our models and the observations, we show that the cloud composition of hot Jupiters likely varies with equilibrium temperature. We suggest that a transition occurs between silicate and manganese sulfide clouds at a temperature near 1600 K, analogous to the L/T transition on brown dwarfs. The cold trapping of cloud species below the photosphere naturally produces such a transition and predicts similar transitions for other condensates, including TiO. We predict that most hot Jupiters should have cloudy nightsides, that partial cloudiness should be common at the limb, and that the dayside hot spot should often be cloud-free.},

However, time is of the essence to take full advantage of this opportunity. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), although delayed, will still complete its nominal five year mission on a timeline that motivates rapid identification, confirmation, and mass measurement of the top atmospheric characterization targets from TESS. Beyond JWST, future dedicated missions for atmospheric studies such as the Atmospheric Remote-sensing Infrared Exoplanet Large-survey (ARIEL) require the discovery and confirmation of several hundred additional sub-Jovian size planets (R p {\textless} 10 R ⊕) orbiting bright stars, beyond those known today, to ensure a successful statistical census of exoplanet atmospheres. Ground-based extremely large telescopes (ELTs) will also contribute to surveying the atmospheres of the transiting planets discovered by TESS. Here we present a set of two straightforward analytic metrics, quantifying the expected signal-to-noise in transmission and thermal emission spectroscopy for a given planet, that will allow the top atmospheric characterization targets to be readily identified among the TESS planet candidates. Targets that meet our proposed threshold values for these metrics would be encouraged for rapid follow-up and confirmation via radial velocity mass measurements. Based on the catalog of simulated TESS detections by Sullivan et al., we determine appropriate cutoff values of the metrics, such that the TESS mission will ultimately yield a sample of ∼300 high-quality atmospheric characterization targets across a range of planet size bins, extending down to Earth-size, potentially habitable worlds.},

	abstract = {The emergent spectra of close-in, giant exoplanets (`hot Jupiters') are expected to be distinct from those of self-luminous objects with similar effective temperatures because hot Jupiters are primarily heated from above by their host stars rather than internally from the release of energy from their formation1. Theoretical models predict a continuum of dayside spectra for hot Jupiters as a function of irradiation level, with the coolest planets having absorption features in their spectra, intermediate-temperature planets having emission features due to thermal inversions and the hottest planets having blackbody-like spectra due to molecular dissociation and continuum opacity from the H− ion2-4. Absorption and emission features have been detected in the spectra of a number of individual hot Jupiters5,6, and population-level trends have been observed in photometric measurements7-15. However, there has been no unified, population-level study of the thermal emission spectra of hot Jupiters as there has been for cooler brown dwarfs16 and transmission spectra of hot Jupiters17. Here we show that hot Jupiter secondary eclipse spectra centred around a water absorption band at 1.4 μm follow a common trend in water feature strength with temperature. The observed trend is broadly consistent with model predictions for how the thermal structures of solar-composition planets vary with irradiation level, but is inconsistent with the predictions of self-consistent one-dimensional models for internally heated objects. This is particularly the case because models of internally heated objects show absorption features at temperatures above 2,000 K, whereas the observed hot Jupiters show emission features and featureless spectra. Nevertheless, the ensemble of planets exhibits some degree of scatter around the mean trend for solar-composition planets. The spread can be accounted for if the planets have modest variations in metallicity and/or elemental abundance ratios, which is expected from planet formation models18-21.},

	abstract = {Hot Jupiters have been predicted to have a strong day/night temperature contrast and a hotspot shifted eastward of the substellar point. This was confirmed by numerous phase curve observations probing the longitudinal brightness variation of the atmosphere. Global circulation models, however, systematically underestimate the phase curve amplitude and overestimate the shift of its maximum. We use a global circulation model including non-grey radiative transfer and realistic gas and cloud opacities to systematically investigate how the atmospheric circulation of hot Jupiters varies with equilibrium temperature from 1000 to 2200 K. We show that the heat transport is very efficient for cloudless planets cooler than 1600 K and becomes less efficient at higher temperatures. When nightside clouds are present, the day-to-night heat transport becomes extremely inefficient, leading to a good match to the observed low nightside temperatures. The constancy of this low temperature is, however, due to the strong dependence of the radiative time-scale with temperature. We further show that nightside clouds increase the phase curve amplitude and decrease the phase curve offset at the same time. This change is very sensitive to the cloud chemical composition and particle size, meaning that the diversity of observed phase curves can be explained by a diversity of nightside cloud properties. Finally, we show that phase curve parameters do not necessarily track the day/night contrast nor the shift of the hotspot on isobars, and propose solutions to to recover the true hotspot shift and day/night contrast.},

	abstract = {Accurate estimations of atmospheric properties of exoplanets from transmission spectra require understanding of degeneracies between model parameters and observations that can resolve them. We conduct a systematic investigation of such degeneracies using a combination of detailed atmospheric retrievals and a range of model assumptions, focusing on H\$\_2\$-rich atmospheres. As a case study, we consider the well-studied hot Jupiter HD 209458 b. We perform extensive retrievals with models ranging from simple isothermal and isobaric atmospheres to those with full pressure-temperature profiles, inhomogeneous cloud/haze coverage, multiple molecular species, and data in the optical-infrared wavelengths. Our study reveals four key insights. First, we find that a combination of models with minimal assumptions and broadband transmission spectra with current facilities allow precise estimates of chemical abundances. In particular, high-precision optical and infrared spectra along with models including variable cloud coverage and prominent opacity sources, Na and K being important in optical, provide joint constraints on cloud/haze properties and chemical abundances. Second, we show that the degeneracy between planetary radius and its reference pressure is well characterised and has little effect on abundance estimates, contrary to previous claims using semi-analytic models. Third, collision induced absorption due to H\$\_2\$-H\$\_2\$ and H\$\_2\$-He interactions plays a critical role in correctly estimating atmospheric abundances. Finally, our results highlight the inadequacy of simplified semi-analytic models with isobaric assumptions for reliable retrievals of transmission spectra. Transmission spectra obtained with current facilities such as HST and VLT can provide strong constraints on atmospheric abundances of exoplanets.},

	abstract = {Over the last several years, spectroscopic observations of transiting exoplanets have begun to uncover information about their atmospheres, including atmospheric composition and indications of the presence of clouds and hazes. Spectral retrieval is the leading technique for interpretation of transmission spectra and is employed by several teams using a variety of forward models and parameter estimation algorithms. However, different model suites have mostly been used in isolation and so it is unknown whether the results from each are comparable. As we approach the launch of the James Webb Space Telescope, we anticipate advances in wavelength coverage, precision, and resolution of transit spectroscopic data, so it is important that the tools that will be used to interpret these information-rich spectra are validated. To this end, we present an intermodel comparison of three retrieval suites: TAUREX, NEMESIS, and CHIMERA. We demonstrate that the forward model spectra are in good agreement (residual deviations on the order of 20-40 ppm), and discuss the results of cross-retrievals among the three tools. Generally, the constraints from the cross-retrievals are consistent with each other and with input values to within 1σ. However, for high precision scenarios with error envelopes of order 30 ppm, subtle differences in the simulated spectra result in discrepancies between the different retrieval suites, and inaccuracies in retrieved values of several σ. This can be considered analogous to substantial systematic/astrophysical noise in a real observation, or errors/omissions in a forward model such as molecular line list incompleteness or missing absorbers.},

	abstract = {Atmospheric retrievals of exoplanetary transmission spectra provide important constraints on various properties, such as chemical abundances, cloud/haze properties, and characteristic temperatures, at the day–night atmospheric terminator. To date, most spectra have been observed for giant exoplanets due to which retrievals typically assume hydrogen-rich atmospheres. However, recent observations of mini Neptunes/super-Earths, and the promise of upcoming facilities including the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), call for a new generation of retrievals that can address a wide range of atmospheric compositions and related complexities. Here we report Aurora, a next-generation atmospheric retrieval framework that builds upon state-of-the-art architectures and incorporates the following key advancements: (a) a generalized compositional retrieval allowing for H-rich and H-poor atmospheres, (b) a generalized prescription for inhomogeneous clouds/hazes, (c) multiple Bayesian inference algorithms for high-dimensional retrievals, (d) modular considerations for refraction, forward scattering, and Mie scattering, and (e) noise modeling functionalities. We demonstrate Aurora on current and/or synthetic observations of the hot Jupiter HD 209458 b, mini Neptune K2-18b, and rocky exoplanet TRAPPIST-1 d. Using current HD 209458 b spectra, we demonstrate the robustness of our framework and cloud/haze prescription against assumptions of H-rich/H-poor atmospheres, improving on previous treatments. Using real and synthetic spectra of K2-18b, we demonstrate an agnostic approach to confidently constrain its bulk atmospheric composition and obtain precise abundance estimates. For TRAPPIST-1 d, 10 JWST-NIRSpec transits can enable identification of the main atmospheric component for cloud-free, CO2-rich, and N2-rich atmospheres and abundance constraints on trace gases, including initial indications of O3 if present at enhanced levels (∼10×–100× Earth levels).},

Astronomers can measure these atmospheric properties by observing how the fraction of starlight blocked by a planet passing in front of its host star changes with wavelength - a technique called transmission spectroscopy. Since the wavelengths where different atoms and molecules absorb are already known (from laboratory measurements or quantum mechanics), astronomers can compare models of exoplanet spectra to observations to infer the chemical composition of exoplanets. POSEIDON is a Python package for the modelling and analysis of exoplanet spectra. POSEIDON has two main functions: (i) computation of model spectra for 1D, 2D, or 3D exoplanet atmospheres; and (ii) a Bayesian fitting routine ('atmospheric retrieval') that can infer the range of atmospheric properties consistent with an observed exoplanet spectrum.},

To some degree, all these studies have relied on modeling of JWST’s theoretical instrument noise. With under two years left until launch, it is imperative that the exoplanet community begins to digest and integrate these studies into their observing plans, as well as think about how to leverage the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) to optimize JWST observations. To encourage this and to allow all members of the community access to JWST \& HST noise simulations, we present here an open-source Python package and online interface for creating observation simulations of all observatory-supported timeseries spectroscopy modes. This noise simulator, called PandExo, relies on some aspects of Space Telescope Science Institute’s Exposure Time Calculator, Pandeia. We describe PandExo and the formalism for computing noise sources for JWST. Then we benchmark PandExo's performance against each instrument team’s independently written noise simulator for JWST, and previous observations for HST. We find that PandExo is within 10\% agreement for HST/WFC3 and for all JWST instruments.},

	abstract = {We present a new method to retrieve molecular abundances and temperature profiles from exoplanet atmosphere photometry and spectroscopy. We run millions of one-dimensional (1D) atmosphere models in order to cover the large range of allowed parameter space. In order to run such a large number of models, we have developed a parametric pressure-temperature (P-T) profile coupled with line-by-line radiative transfer, hydrostatic equilibrium, and energy balance, along with prescriptions for non-equilibrium molecular composition and energy redistribution. The major difference from traditional 1D radiative transfer models is the parametric P-T profile, which essentially means adopting energy balance only at the top of the atmosphere and not in each layer. We see the parametric P-T model as a parallel approach to the traditional exoplanet atmosphere models that rely on several free parameters to encompass unknown absorbers and energy redistribution. The parametric P-T profile captures the basic physical features of temperature structures in planetary atmospheres (including temperature inversions), and fits a wide range of published P-T profiles, including those of solar system planets. We apply our temperature and abundance retrieval method to the atmospheres of two transiting exoplanets, HD 189733b and HD 209458b, which have the best Spitzer and Hubble Space Telescope data available. For HD 189733b, we find efficient day-night redistribution of energy in the atmosphere, and molecular abundance constraints confirming the presence of H2O, CO, CH4, and CO2. For HD 209458b, we confirm and constrain the dayside thermal inversion in an average 1D temperature profile. We also report independent detections of H2O, CO, CH4, and CO2 on the dayside of HD 209458b, based on six-channel Spitzer photometry. We report constraints for HD 189733b due to individual data sets separately; a few key observations are variable in different data sets at similar wavelengths. Moreover, a noticeably strong CO2 absorption in one data set is significantly weaker in another. We must, therefore, acknowledge the strong possibility that the atmosphere is variable, both in its energy redistribution state and in the chemical abundances.},

All retrieval models attempt to extract the maximum amount of atmospheric information from finite sets of data, but while the problem to be solved is fundamentally the same for any planetary atmosphere, until now all such models have been assembled ad hoc to address data from individual missions. In this paper, we describe a new general-purpose retrieval model, Non-linear Optimal Estimator for MultivariatE Spectral analySIS (NEMESIS), which was originally developed to interpret observations of Saturn and Titan from the composite infrared spectrometer on board the NASA Cassini spacecraft. NEMESIS has been constructed to be generally applicable to any planetary atmosphere and can be applied from the visible/near-infrared right out to microwave wavelengths, modelling both reflected sunlight and thermal emission in either scattering or non-scattering conditions. NEMESIS has now been successfully applied to the analysis of data from many planetary missions and also ground-based observations.},

The challenge is to quantitatively determine the range of temperatures and molecular abundances allowed by the data, which is often difficult given the low information content of most exoplanet spectra that commonly leads to degeneracies in the interpretation. A variety of spectral retrieval approaches have been applied to exoplanet spectra, but no previous investigations have sought to compare these approaches. We compare three different retrieval methods: optimal estimation, differential evolution Markov chain Monte Carlo, and bootstrap Monte Carlo on a synthetic water-dominated hot Jupiter. We discuss expectations of uncertainties in abundances and temperatures given current and potential future observations. In general, we find that the three approaches agree for high spectral resolution, high signal-to-noise data expected to come from potential future spaceborne missions, but disagree for low-resolution, low signal-to-noise spectra representative of current observations. We also compare the results from a parameterized temperature profile versus a full classical Level-by-Level approach and discriminate in which situations each of these approaches is applicable. Furthermore, we discuss the implications of our models for the inferred C-to-O ratios of exoplanetary atmospheres. Specifically, we show that in the observational limit of a few photometric points, the retrieved C/O is biased toward values near solar and near one simply due to the assumption of uninformative priors.},

We identify differences in physical and chemical processes that are taken into account thanks to a benchmark protocol we have developed. We study the impact of these differences on the analysis of observable spectra. We show the importance of selecting carefully relevant molecular linelists to compute the atmospheric opacity. Indeed, differences between spectra calculated with Hitran and ExoMol exceed the expected uncertainties of future JWST observations. We also show the limits of the precision of the models due to uncertainties on alkali and molecule lineshape, which induce spectral effects that are also larger than the expected JWST uncertainties. We compare two chemical models, Exo-REM and Venot Chemical Code, which do not lead to significant differences in the emission or transmission spectra. We discuss the observational consequences of using equilibrium or out-of-equilibrium chemistry and the major impact of phosphine, detectable with the JWST.

	shorttitle = {{WASP}-39b},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08492},
	abstract = {WASP-39b is one of the first extrasolar giant gas planets that has been observed within the JWST ERS program. Fundamental properties that may enable the link to exoplanet formation differ amongst retrieval methods, for example metallicity and mineral ratios. In this work, the formation of clouds in the atmosphere of WASP-39b is explored to investigate how inhomogeneous cloud properties (particle sizes, material composition, opacity) may be for this intermediately warm gaseous exoplanet. WASP-39b's atmosphere has a comparable day-night temperature median with sufficiently low temperatures that clouds may form globally. The presence of clouds on WASP-39b can explain observations without resorting to a high ({\textgreater} 100x solar) metallicity atmosphere for a reduced vertical mixing efficiency. The assessment of mineral ratios shows an under-depletion of S/O due to condensation compared to C/O, Mg/O, Si/O, Fe/O ratios. Vertical patchiness due to heterogeneous cloud composition challenges simple cloud models. An equal mixture of silicates and metal oxides is expected to characterise the cloud top. Further, optical properties of Fe and Mg silicates in the mid-infrared differ significantly which will impact the interpretation of JWST observations. We conclude that WASP-39b's atmosphere contains clouds and the underdepletion of S/O by atmospheric condensation processes suggest the use of sulphur gas species as a possible link to primordial element abundances. Over-simplified cloud models do not capture the complex nature of mixed-condensate clouds in exoplanet atmospheres. The clouds in the observable upper atmosphere of WASP-39b are a mixture of different silicates and metal oxides. The use of constant particles sizes and/or one-material cloud particles alone to interpret spectra may not be sufficient to capture the full complexity available through JWST observations.},

	abstract = {We present a new method to retrieve molecular abundances and temperature profiles from exoplanet atmosphere photometry and spectroscopy. We run millions of one-dimensional (1D) atmosphere models in order to cover the large range of allowed parameter space. In order to run such a large number of models, we have developed a parametric pressure-temperature (P-T) profile coupled with line-by-line radiative transfer, hydrostatic equilibrium, and energy balance, along with prescriptions for non-equilibrium molecular composition and energy redistribution. The major difference from traditional 1D radiative transfer models is the parametric P-T profile, which essentially means adopting energy balance only at the top of the atmosphere and not in each layer. We see the parametric P-T model as a parallel approach to the traditional exoplanet atmosphere models that rely on several free parameters to encompass unknown absorbers and energy redistribution. The parametric P-T profile captures the basic physical features of temperature structures in planetary atmospheres (including temperature inversions), and fits a wide range of published P-T profiles, including those of solar system planets. We apply our temperature and abundance retrieval method to the atmospheres of two transiting exoplanets, HD 189733b and HD 209458b, which have the best Spitzer and Hubble Space Telescope data available. For HD 189733b, we find efficient day-night redistribution of energy in the atmosphere, and molecular abundance constraints confirming the presence of H{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}O, CO, CH{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}4{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, and CO{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}. For HD 209458b, we confirm and constrain the dayside thermal inversion in an average 1D temperature profile. We also report independent detections of H{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}O, CO, CH{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}4{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, and CO{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} on the dayside of HD 209458b, based on six-channel Spitzer photometry. We report constraints for HD 189733b due to individual data sets separately; a few key observations are variable in different data sets at similar wavelengths. Moreover, a noticeably strong CO{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} absorption in one data set is significantly weaker in another. We must, therefore, acknowledge the strong possibility that the atmosphere is variable, both in its energy redistribution state and in the chemical abundances.},

	abstract = {Until recently, infrared observations of exoplanetary atmospheres have typically been interpreted using models that assumed solar elemental abundances. With the chemical composition fixed, attempts have been made to classify hot Jupiter atmospheres on the basis of stellar irradiation. However, recent observations have revealed deviations from predictions based on such classification schemes, and chemical compositions retrieved from some data sets have also indicated non-solar abundances. The data require a two-dimensional (2D) characterization scheme with dependence on both irradiation and chemistry. In this work, we suggest the carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) ratio as an important second dimension for characterizing exoplanetary atmospheres. In hot-hydrogen-dominated atmospheres, the C/O ratio critically influences the relative concentrations of several spectroscopically dominant species. Between a C/O of 0.5 (solar value) and 2, the H2O and CH4 abundances can vary by several orders of magnitude in the observable atmosphere, and new hydrocarbon species such as HCN and C2H2 become prominent for C/O {\textgreater}= 1, while the CO abundance remains almost unchanged. Furthermore, a C/O {\textgreater}= 1 can preclude a strong thermal inversion due to TiO and VO in a hot Jupiter atmosphere, since TiO and VO are naturally underabundant for C/O {\textgreater}= 1. We, therefore, suggest a new 2D classification scheme for hydrogen-dominated exoplanetary atmospheres with irradiation (or temperature) and C/O ratio as the two dimensions. We define four classes in this 2D space (O1, O2, C1, and C2) with distinct chemical, thermal, and spectral properties. Based on the most recent observations, we characterize the thermal structure and C/O ratios of six hot Jupiters (XO-1b, CoRoT-2b, WASP-14b, WASP-19b, WASP-33b, and WASP-12b) in the framework of our proposed 2D classification scheme. While the data for several systems in our sample are consistent with C-rich atmospheres, new observations are required to conclusively constrain their C/O ratios in the day side as well as the terminator regions of their atmospheres. We discuss how observations using existing and forthcoming facilities can constrain C/O ratios in exoplanetary atmospheres.},

Recent observations suggest that some exoplanets, e.g., Wasp 12-b, have atmospheric C/O ratios substantially different from the solar value of 0.54. In this Letter, we present a mechanism that can produce such atmospheric deviations from the stellar C/O ratio. In protoplanetary disks, different snowlines of oxygen- and carbon-rich ices, especially water and carbon monoxide, will result in systematic variations in the C/O ratio both in the gas and in the condensed phases. In particular, between the H2O and CO snowlines most oxygen is present in icy grains—the building blocks of planetary cores in the core accretion model—while most carbon remains in the gas phase. This region is coincidental with the giant-planet-forming zone for a range of observed protoplanetary disks. Based on standard core accretion models of planet formation, gas giants that sweep up most of their atmospheres from disk gas outside of the water snowline will have a C/O {\textasciitilde} 1, while atmospheres significantly contaminated by evaporating planetesimals will have a stellar or substellar C/O when formed at the same disk radius. The overall metallicity will also depend on the atmosphere formation mechanism, and exoplanetary atmospheric compositions may therefore provide constraints on where and how a specific planet formed.},

This inclination makes possible investigations of the planet atmosphere. In this paper we discuss the planet transmission spectra during a transit. The basic tenet of the method is that the planet atmosphere absorption features will be superimposed on the stellar flux as the stellar flux passes through the planet atmosphere above the limb. The ratio of the planet's transparent atmosphere area to the star area is small ({\textasciitilde}10-3 to 10-4) for this method to work, very strong planet spectral features are necessary. We use our models of close-in extrasolar giant planets to estimate promising absorption signatures: the alkali metal lines; in particular, the Na I and K I resonance doublets; and the He I 2 3S-2 3P triplet line at 1083.0 nm. If successful, observations will constrain the line-of-sight temperature, pressure, and density. The most important point is that observations will constrain the cloud depth, which in turn will distinguish between different atmosphere models. We also discuss the potential of this method for extrasolar giant planets at different orbital distances and orbiting nonsolar-type stars.},

Using these data, we disentangle the effects of limb darkening, measurement systematics and spots on the surface of the host star, to calculate the wavelength dependence of the effective transit radius to an accuracy of {\textasciitilde}50 km. This constitutes the `transmission spectrum' of the planetary atmosphere. It indicates at each wavelength at what height the planetary atmosphere becomes opaque to the grazing stellar light during the transit. In this wavelength range, strong features due to sodium, potassium and water are predicted by atmosphere models for a planet like HD 189733b, but they can be hidden by broad absorption from clouds or hazes higher up in the atmosphere. We observed an almost featureless transmission spectrum between 550 and 1050 nm, with no indication of the expected sodium or potassium atomic absorption features. Comparison of our results with the transit radius observed in the near and mid-infrared (2-8 μm), and the slope of the spectrum, suggest the presence of a haze of submicrometre particles in the upper atmosphere of the planet.},

	abstract = {The elemental compositions of hot Jupiters are informative relics of planet formation that can help us answer long-standing questions regarding the origin and formation of giant planets. Here, I present the main conclusions from a comprehensive atmospheric retrieval survey of eight hot Jupiters with detectable molecular absorption in their near-infrared transmission spectra. I analyze the eight transmission spectra using the newly-developed, self-consistent atmospheric retrieval framework, SCARLET. Unlike previous methods, SCARLET combines the physical and chemical consistency of complex atmospheric models with the statistical treatment of observational uncertainties known from atmospheric retrieval techniques. I find that all eight hot Jupiters consistently require carbon-to-oxygen ratios (C/O) below 0.9. The finding of C/O{\textless}0.9 is highly robust for HD209458b, WASP-12b, WASP-19b, HAT-P-1b, and XO-1b. For HD189733b, WASP-17b, and WASP-43b, I find that the published WFC3 transmission spectra favor C/O{\textless}0.9 at greater than 95\% confidence. I further show that the water abundances on all eight hot Jupiters are consistent with solar composition. The relatively small depth of the detected water absorption features is due to the presence of clouds, not due to a low water abundance as previously suggested for HD209458b. The presence of a thick cloud deck is inferred for HD209458b and WASP-12b. HD189733b may host a similar cloud deck, rather than the previously suggested Rayleigh hazes, if star spots affect the observed spectrum. The approach taken in SCARLET can be regarded as a new pathway to interpreting spectral observations of planetary atmospheres. In this work, including our prior knowledge of H-C-N-O chemistry enables me to constrain the C/O ratio without detecting a single carbon-bearing molecule.},

The rotational-vibrational transition bands of water, carbon monoxide and methane are anticipated to be the primary sources of non-continuum opacity in hot-Jupiter planets. As these bands can overlap in wavelength, and the corresponding signatures from them are weak, decisive identification requires precision infrared spectroscopy. Here we report a near-infrared transmission spectrum of the planet HD 189733b that shows the presence of methane. Additionally, a resolved water vapour band at 1.9μm confirms the recent claim of water in this object. On thermochemical grounds, carbon monoxide is expected to be abundant in the upper atmosphere of hot-Jupiter planets, but is not identifiable here; therefore the detection of methane rather than carbon monoxide in such a hot planet could signal the presence of a horizontal chemical gradient away from the permanent dayside, or it may imply an ill-understood photochemical mechanism that leads to an enhancement of methane.},

	abstract = {Detailed characterization of exoplanets has begun to yield measurements of their atmospheric properties that constrain the planets’ origins and evolution. For example, past observations of the dayside emission spectrum of the hot Jupiter WASP-12b indicated that its atmosphere has a high carbon-to-oxygen ratio (C/O {\textgreater} 1), suggesting it had a different formation pathway than is commonly assumed for giant planets. Here we report a precise near-infrared transmission spectrum for WASP-12b based on six transit observations with the Hubble Space Telescope/Wide Field Camera 3. We bin the data in 13 spectrophotometric light curves from 0.84 to 1.67 μm and measure the transit depths to a median precision of 51 ppm. We retrieve the atmospheric properties using the transmission spectrum and find strong evidence for water absorption (7σ confidence). This detection marks the first high-confidence, spectroscopic identification of a molecule in the atmosphere of WASP-12b. The retrieved 1 σ water volume mixing ratio is between 10-5 and 10-2, which is consistent with C/O {\textgreater} 1 to within 2σ. However, we also introduce a new retrieval parameterization that fits for C/O and metallicity under the assumption of chemical equilibrium. With this approach, we constrain C/O to \{0.5\}-0.3+0.2 at 1σ and rule out a carbon-rich atmosphere composition (C/O {\textgreater} 1) at {\textgreater}3σ confidence. Further observations and modeling of the planet’s global thermal structure and dynamics would aid in resolving the tension between our inferred C/O and previous constraints. Our findings highlight the importance of obtaining high-precision data with multiple observing techniques in order to obtain robust constraints on the chemistry and physics of exoplanet atmospheres.},

	abstract = {We present a forward-modeling framework using the Bayesian inference tool Starfish and cloudless Sonora-Bobcat model atmospheres to analyze low-resolution (R ≈ 80–250) near-infrared (1.0–2.5 μm) spectra of T dwarfs. Our approach infers effective temperatures, surface gravities, metallicities, radii, and masses, and by accounting for uncertainties from model interpolation and correlated residuals due to instrumental effects and modeling systematics, produces more realistic parameter posteriors than traditional (χ 2-based) spectral-fitting analyses. We validate our framework by fitting the model atmospheres themselves and finding negligible offsets between derived and input parameters. We apply our methodology to three well-known benchmark late-T dwarfs, HD 3651B, GJ 570D, and Ross 458C, using both solar and nonsolar metallicity atmospheric models. We also derive these benchmarks’ physical properties using their bolometric luminosities, their primary stars’ ages and metallicities, and Sonora-Bobcat evolutionary models. Assuming the evolutionary-based parameters are more robust, we find our atmospheric-based, forward-modeling analysis produces two outcomes. For HD 3615B and GJ 570D, spectral fits provide accurate T eff and R but underestimated (by ≈1.2 dex) and Z (by ≈0.35 dex), likely due to the systematics from modeling the potassium line profiles. For Ross 458C, spectral fits provide accurate and Z but overestimated T eff (by ≈120 K) and underestimated R (by ≈1.6×), likely because our model atmospheres lack clouds, reduced vertical temperature gradients, or disequilibrium processes. Finally, the spectroscopically inferred masses of these benchmarks are all considerably underestimated.},

	abstract = {Clouds are ubiquitous in extrasolar planet atmospheres and are critical to our understanding of planetary climate and chemistry. They also represent one of the greater challenges to overcome when trying to interpret transit transmission spectra of exoplanet atmospheres as their presence can inhibit precise constraints on atmospheric composition and thermal properties. In this work, we take a phenomenological approach toward understanding (1) our ability to constrain bulk cloud properties and (2) the impact of clouds on constraining various atmospheric properties as obtained through transmission spectroscopy with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). We do this by exploring retrievals of atmospheric and cloud properties for a generic “hot Jupiter” as a function of signal-to-noise ratio (S/N), JWST observing modes, and four different cloud parameterizations. We find that most key atmospheric and cloud inferences can be well constrained in the wavelength range (λ = 0.6–11 μm), with NIRCam (λ = 2.5–5 μm) being critical in inferring atmospheric properties and NIRISS + MIRI (λ = 0.6–2.5, 5–11 μm) being necessary for good constraints on cloud parameters. However, constraining the cloud abundance and therefore the total cloud mass requires an observable cloud base in the transit geometry. While higher S/N observations can place tighter constraints on major parameters such as temperature, metallicity, and cloud sedimentation, they are unable to eliminate strong degeneracies among cloud parameters. Our investigation of a generic “warm Neptune” with photochemical haze parameterization also shows promising results in constraining atmospheric and haze properties in the cooler temperature regime.},

	abstract = {About 70-80\% of stars in our solar and galactic neighborhood are M dwarfs. They span a range of low masses and temperatures relative to solar-type stars, facilitating molecule formation throughout their atmospheres. Standard stellar atmosphere models primarily designed for FGK stars face challenges when characterizing broadband molecular features in spectra of cool stars. Here, we introduce SPHINX--a new 1-D self-consistent radiative-convective thermochemical equilibrium chemistry model grid of atmospheres and spectra for M dwarfs in low-resolution (R{\textasciitilde}250). We incorporate the latest pre-computed absorption cross-sections with pressure-broadening for key molecules dominant in late-K, early/main-sequence-M stars. We then validate our grid models by acquiring fundamental properties (Teff, log(g), [M/H], radius, and C/O) for 10 benchmark M+G binary stars with known host metallicities and 10 M dwarfs with interferometrically measured angular diameters. Incorporating a Gaussian-process inference tool Starfish, we account for correlated and systematic noise in low-resolution (spectral stitching of SpeX, SNIFS, and STIS) observations and derive robust estimates of fundamental M dwarf atmospheric parameters. Additionally, we assess the influence of photospheric heterogeneity on acquired [M/H] and find that it could explain some deviations from observations. We also probe whether the model-assumed convective mixing-length parameter influences inferred radii, effective temperature, and [M/H] and again find that may explain discrepancies between interferometry observations and model-derived stellar parameters for cooler M dwarfs. Mainly, we show the unique strength in leveraging broadband molecular absorption features occurring in low-resolution M dwarf spectra and demonstrate the ability to improve constraints on fundamental properties of exoplanet hosts and late brown dwarf companions.},

	abstract = {Ultra-cool brown dwarfs offer a unique window into understanding substellar atmospheric physics and chemistry. Their strong molecular absorption bands at infrared wavelengths, Jupiter-like radii, cool temperatures, and lack of complicating stellar irradiation make them ideal test beds for understanding Jovian-like atmospheres. Here, we report the findings of a uniform atmospheric retrieval analysis on a set of 14 Y- and T-type dwarfs observed with the Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 instrument. From our retrieval analysis, we find the temperature structures to be largely consistent with radiative-convective equilibrium in most objects. We also determine the abundances of water, methane, and ammonia, as well as upper limits on the alkali metals sodium and potassium. The constraints on water and methane are consistent with predictions from chemical equilibrium models, while those of ammonia may be affected by vertical disequilibrium mixing, consistent with previous works. Our key result stems from the constraints on the alkali metal abundances where we find their continued depletion with decreasing effective temperature, consistent with the trend identified in a previous retrieval analysis on a sample of slightly warmer late T-dwarfs in Line et al. (2017). These constraints show that the previously observed Y-J color trend across the T/Y transition is most likely due to the depletion of these metals, in accordance with predictions from equilibrium condensate rainout chemistry. Finally, we simulate future James Webb Space Telescope observations of ultra-cool dwarfs and find that the Near Infrared Spectrometer (NIRSpec) PRISM offers the best chance at developing high-precision constraints on fundamental atmospheric characteristics.},

The wavelength-dependent nature of stellar surface heterogeneities imprinting their signatures on planetary transmission spectra are of concern particularly for systems of sub-Neptunes orbiting M-dwarfs. Here we present a systematic exploration of the impact of this spot-contamination on simulated near-infrared transmission spectra of sub-Neptune planets. From our analysis, we find that improper correction for stellar surface heterogeneities on transmission spectra can lead to significant bias when inferring planetary atmospheric properties. However, this bias is negligible for lower fractions of heterogeneities ({\textless}1\%). Additionally, we find that acquiring a priori knowledge of stellar heterogeneities does not improve precision in constraining planetary parameters if the heterogeneities are appropriately marginalized within a retrieval; however, these are conditional on our confidence of stellar atmospheric models being accurate representations of the true photosphere. In sum, to acquire unbiased constraints when characterizing planetary atmospheres with the James Webb Space Telescope, we recommend performing joint retrievals of both the disk-integrated spectrum of the star and the stellar-contamination-corrected transmission spectrum.},

JWST spectra in the 3-5 μm range provide a promising avenue for chemical detections while encompassing a window in cloud opacity for several prominent aerosols. We confirm recent inferences of CO2, SO2, H2O, and CO in WASP-39 b; report tentative evidence for H2S; and retrieve elemental abundances consistent with Saturn's metallicity. We retrieve molecular abundances with {\textasciitilde}0.3-0.6 dex precision with this relatively limited spectral range. When considering the 3-5 μm data alone, reported differences in spectra with different reduction pipelines can affect abundance estimates by up to {\textasciitilde}1 dex and the detectability of less prominent species. Complementing with data at shorter wavelengths, e.g., with other JWST instruments or HST WFC3 ({\textasciitilde}0.8-1.7 μm), can significantly improve the accuracy and precision of the abundance estimates. The high data quality enables constraints on aerosol properties, including their composition, modal size, and extent, motivating their consideration in retrievals. Our results highlight the promise of JWST exoplanet spectroscopy, while underscoring the importance of robust data reduction and atmospheric retrieval approaches in the JWST era.},

Previous observations have shown a diversity of hot Jupiter eclipse spectra, including absorption features, emission features, and featureless blackbody-like spectra. We present a secondary eclipse spectrum of the hot Jupiter WASP-77Ab observed between 1 and 5 μm with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and the Spitzer Space Telescope. The HST observations show signs of water absorption indicative of a noninverted thermal structure. We fit the data with both a one-dimensional free retrieval and a grid of one-dimensional self-consistent forward models to confirm this noninverted structure. The free retrieval places a 3σ lower limit on the atmospheric water abundance of \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{log\}(\{n\}\_\{\{\{{\textbackslash}rm\{H\}\}\}\_\{2\}\{{\textbackslash}rm\{O\}\}\}) -4.78\$ and cannot constrain the CO abundance. The grid fit produces a slightly superstellar metallicity and constrains the carbon-to-oxygen ratio to less than or equal to the solar value. We also compare our data to recent high-resolution observations of WASP-77Ab taken with the IGRINS/IGRINS spectrograph. We find that the best-fit model to the IGRINS data gives a reduced chi squared of χ2 ν = 1.32 when compared to the WFC3 data. However, the metallicity derived from the IGRINS data is significantly lower than that derived from our self-consistent model fit. We find that this difference may be due to disequilibrium chemistry, and the varying results between the models applied here demonstrate the model dependence of derived metallicities when comparing to low-resolution, low-wavelength coverage data alone. Future work to combine observations from IGRINS, HST, and the James Webb Space Telescope will improve our estimate of the atmospheric composition of WASP-77Ab.},

Hence, the presence of atomic Li has served as an indicator of the nearby H-burning boundary at about 75 MJ between brown dwarfs and very low mass stars. Historically, the "lithium test," a search for the presence of the Li line at 670.8 nm, has been a marker if an object has a substellar mass. While the Li test could, in principle, be used to distinguish masses of later-type L-T dwarfs, Li is predominantly no longer found as an atomic gas but rather a molecular species such as LiH, LiF, LiOH, and LiCl in cooler atmospheres. The L- and T-type dwarfs are quite faint at 670 nm and thus challenging targets for high-resolution spectroscopy. But only recently have experimental molecular line lists become available for the molecular Li species, allowing molecular Li mass discrimination. Here we generated the latest opacity of these Li-bearing molecules and performed a thermochemical equilibrium atmospheric composition calculation of their abundances. Finally, we computed thermal emission spectra for a series of radiative-convective equilibrium models of cloudy and cloudless brown dwarf atmospheres (with Teff = 500-2400 K and \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{log\}g=4.0{\textbackslash}mbox\{--\}5.0\$ ) to understand where the presence of atmospheric lithium-bearing species is most easily detected as a function of brown dwarf mass and age. After atomic Li, the best spectral signatures were found to be LiF at 10.5-12.5 μm and LiCl at 14.5-18.5 μm. Also, LiH shows a narrow feature at {\textasciitilde}9.38 μm.},

Here we present a database of precomputed absorption cross sections for all isotopologues of key atmospheric molecules relevant to late-type stellar, brown dwarf, and planetary atmospheres: MgH, AlH, CaH, TiH, CrH, FeH, SiO, TiO, VO, and H2O. The pressure and temperature ranges of the computed opacities are 10-6-3000 bar and 75-4000 K, and their spectral ranges are 0.25-330 μm for many cases where possible. For cases with no pressure-broadening data, we use collision theory to bridge the gap. We also probe the effect of absorption cross sections calculated from different line lists in the context of ultrahot Jupiter and M-dwarf atmospheres. Using 1D self-consistent radiative-convective thermochemical equilibrium models, we report significant variations in the theoretical spectra and thermal profiles of substellar atmospheres. With a 2000 K representative ultrahot Jupiter, we report variations of up to 320 and 80 ppm in transmission and thermal emission spectra, respectively. For a 3000 K M-dwarf, we find differences of up to 125\% in the spectra. We find that the most significant differences arise as a result of the choice of TiO line lists, primarily below 1 μm. In summary, (1) we present a database of precomputed molecular absorption cross sections, and (2) we quantify biases that arise when characterizing substellar/exoplanet atmospheres as a result of differences in the line lists, therefore highlighting the importance of correct and complete opacities for eventual applications to high-precision spectroscopy and photometry.},

	abstract = {State of the art spectral retrieval models of exoplanet atmospheres assume constant chemical profiles with altitude. This assumption is justified by the information content of current data sets which do not allow, in most cases, for the molecular abundances as a function of pressure to be constrained. In the context of the next generation of telescopes, a more accurate description of chemical profiles may become crucial to interpret observations and gain new insights into atmospheric physics. We explore here the possibility of retrieving pressure-dependent chemical profiles from transit spectra, without injecting any priors from theoretical chemical models in our retrievals. The “two-layer” parameterization presented here allows for the independent extraction of molecular abundances above and below a certain atmospheric pressure. By simulating various cases, we demonstrate that this evolution from constant chemical abundances is justified by the information content of spectra provided by future space instruments. Comparisons with traditional retrieval models show that assumptions made on chemical profiles may significantly impact retrieved parameters, such as the atmospheric temperature, and justify the attention we give here to this issue. We find that the two-layer retrieval accurately captures discontinuities in the vertical chemical profiles, which could be caused by disequilibrium processes—such as photochemistry—or the presence of clouds/hazes. The two-layer retrieval could also help to constrain the composition of clouds and hazes by exploring the correlation between the chemical changes in the gaseous phase and the pressure at which the condensed phase occurs. The two-layer retrieval presented here therefore represents an important step forward in our ability to constrain theoretical chemical models and cloud/haze composition from the analysis of future observations.},

	abstract = {In recent years, it has become clear that a substantial fraction of transiting exoplanets have some form of aerosol present in their atmospheres. Transit spectroscopy – mostly of hot Jupiters, but also of some smaller planets – has provided evidence for this, in the form of steep downward slopes from blue to red in the optical part of the spectrum, and muted gas absorption features throughout. Retrieval studies seeking to constrain the composition of exoplanet atmospheres must therefore account for the presence of aerosols. However, clouds and hazes are complex physical phenomena, and the transit spectra that are currently available allow us to constrain only some of their properties. Therefore, representation of aerosols in retrieval models requires that they are described by only a few parameters, and this has been done in a variety of ways within the literature. Here, I investigate a range of parametrizations for exoplanet aerosol and their effects on retrievals from transmission spectra of hot Jupiters HD 189733b and HD 209458b. I find that results qualitatively agree for the cloud/haze itself regardless of the parametrization used, and indeed using multiple approaches provides a more holistic picture; the retrieved abundance of H2O is also very robust to assumptions about aerosols. I also find strong evidence that aerosol on HD 209458b covers less than half of the terminator region, whilst the picture is less clear for HD 189733b.},

	abstract = {The observed atmospheric spectrum of exoplanets and brown dwarfs depends critically on the presence and distribution of atmospheric condensates. The Ackerman and Marley methodology for predicting the vertical distribution of condensate particles is widely used to study cloudy atmospheres and has recently been implemented in an open-source python package, Virga. The model relies upon input parameter f sed, the sedimentation efficiency, which until now has been held constant. The relative simplicity of this model renders it useful for retrieval studies due to its rapidly attainable solutions. However, comparisons with more complex microphysical models such as CARMA have highlighted inconsistencies between the two approaches, namely that the cloud parameters needed for radiative transfer produced by Virga are dissimilar to those produced by CARMA. To address these discrepancies, we have extended the original Ackerman and Marley methodology in Virga to allow for non-constant f sed values, in particular, those that vary with altitude. We discuss one such parameterization and compare the cloud mass mixing ratio produced by Virga with constant and variable f sed profiles to that produced by CARMA. We find that the variable f sed formulation better captures the profile produced by CARMA with heterogeneous nucleation, yet performs comparatively to constant f sed for homogeneous nucleation. In general, Virga has the capacity to handle any f sed with an explicit anti-derivative, permitting a plethora of alternative cloud profiles that are otherwise unattainable by constant f sed values. The ensuing flexibility has the potential to better agree with increasingly complex models and observed data.},

	abstract = {Condensation clouds in substellar atmospheres have been widely inferred from spectra and photometric variability. Up until now, their horizontally averaged vertical distribution and mean particle size have been largely characterized using models, one of which is the eddy diffusion–sedimentation model from Ackerman and Marley that relies on a sedimentation efficiency parameter, fsed, to determine the vertical extent of clouds in the atmosphere. However, the physical processes controlling the vertical structure of clouds in substellar atmospheres are not well understood. In this work, we derive trends in fsed across a large range of eddy diffusivities (Kzz), gravities, material properties, and cloud formation pathways by fitting cloud distributions calculated by a more detailed cloud microphysics model. We find that fsed is dependent on Kzz, but not gravity, when Kzz is held constant. fsed is most sensitive to the nucleation rate of cloud particles, as determined by material properties like surface energy and molecular weight. High surface energy materials form fewer, larger cloud particles, leading to large fsed ({\textgreater}1), and vice versa for materials with low surface energy. For cloud formation via heterogeneous nucleation, fsed is sensitive to the condensation nuclei flux and radius, connecting cloud formation in substellar atmospheres to the objects’ formation environments and other atmospheric aerosols. These insights could lead to improved cloud models that help us better understand substellar atmospheres. For example, we demonstrate that fsed could increase with increasing cloud base depth in an atmosphere, shedding light on the nature of the brown dwarf L/T transition.},

	abstract = {Sub-Neptune exoplanets are commonly hypothesized to consist of a silicate-rich magma ocean topped by a hydrogen-rich atmosphere. Previous work studying the outgassing of silicate material has demonstrated that such atmosphere-interior interactions can affect the atmosphere's overall structure and extent. But these models only considered SiO in an atmosphere of hydrogen gas, without considering chemical reactions between them. Here we couple calculations of the chemical equilibrium between H, Si, and O species with an atmospheric structure model. We find that substantial amounts of silane, SiH\$\_4\$, and water, H\$\_2\$O, are produced by the interaction between the silicate-rich interior and hydrogen-rich atmosphere. These species extend high into the atmosphere, though their abundance is greatest at the hottest, deepest regions. For example, for a 4 \$M\_{\textbackslash}oplus\$ planet with an equilibrium temperature of 1000 K, a base temperature of 5000 K, and a 0.1 \$M\_{\textbackslash}oplus\$ hydrogen envelope, silicon species and water can comprise 30 percent of the atmosphere by number at the bottom of the atmosphere. Due to this abundance enhancement, we find that convection is inhibited at temperatures \${\textbackslash}gtrsim 2500\$ K. This temperature is lower, implying that the resultant non-convective region is thicker, than was found in previous models which did not account for atmospheric chemistry. Our findings show that significant endogenous water is be produced by magma-hydrogen interactions alone, without the need to accrete ice-rich material. We discuss the observability of the signatures of atmosphere-interior interaction and directions for future work, including condensate lofting and more complex chemical networks.},

	abstract = {Ages and masses of young stars are often estimated by comparing their luminosities and effective temperatures to pre-main-sequence stellar evolution tracks, but magnetic fields and starspots complicate both the observations and evolution. To understand their influence, we study the heavily spotted weak-lined T-Tauri star LkCa 4 by searching for spectral signatures of radiation originating from the starspot or starspot groups. We introduce a new methodology for constraining both the starspot filling factor and the spot temperature by fitting two-temperature stellar atmosphere models constructed from Phoenix synthetic spectra to a high-resolution near-IR IGRINS spectrum. Clearly discernable spectral features arise from both a hot photospheric component \{T\}\{hot\} ∼ 4100 K and a cool component \{T\}\{cool\} ∼ 2700-3000 K, which covers ∼80\% of the visible surface. This mix of hot and cool emission is supported by analyses of the spectral energy distribution, rotational modulation of colors and of TiO band strengths, and features in low-resolution optical/near-IR spectroscopy. Although the revised effective temperature and luminosity make LkCa 4 appear to be much younger and of much lower mass than previous estimates from unspotted stellar evolution models, appropriate estimates will require the production and adoption of spotted evolutionary models. Biases from starspots likely afflict most fully convective young stars and contribute to uncertainties in ages and age spreads of open clusters. In some spectral regions, starspots act as a featureless “veiling” continuum owing to high rotational broadening and heavy line blanketing in cool star spectra. Some evidence is also found for an anticorrelation between the velocities of the warm and cool components.},

	abstract = {Detecting planetary signatures in radial velocity time-series of young stars is challenging due to their inherently strong stellar activity. However, it is possible to learn information about the properties of the stellar signal by using activity indicators measured from the same stellar spectra used to extract radial velocities. In this manuscript, we present a reanalysis of spectroscopic HARPS data of the young star K2-233, which hosts three transiting planets. We perform a multidimensional Gaussian Process regression on the radial velocity and the activity indicators to characterise the planetary Doppler signals. We demonstrate, for the first time on a real dataset, that the use of a multidimensional Gaussian Process can boost the precision with which we measure the planetary signals compared to a one-dimensional Gaussian Process applied to the radial velocities alone. We measure the semi-amplitudes of K2-233 b, c, and d as 1.31(-0.74)(+0.81), 1.81(-0.67)(+0.71), and 2.72(-0.70)(+0.66) m/s, which translates into planetary masses of 2.4(-1.3)(+1.5), 4.6(-1.7)(+1.8), and 10.3(-2.6)(+2.4), respectively. These new mass measurements make K2-233 d a valuable target for transmission spectroscopy observations with JWST. K2-233 is the only young system with two detected inner planets below the radius valley and a third outer planet above it. This makes it an excellent target to perform comparative studies, to inform our theories of planet evolution, formation, migration, and atmospheric evolution.},

Debate rages on whether weak H2O features seen in exoplanet spectra are due to clouds or inherently depleted oxygen. Assertions of solar H2O abundances have relied on making a priori model assumptions, for example, chemical/radiative equilibrium. In this work, we attempt to address this problem with a new retrieval paradigm for transmission spectra. We introduce poseidon, a two-dimensional atmospheric retrieval algorithm including generalized inhomogeneous clouds. We demonstrate that this prescription allows one to break vital degeneracies between clouds and prominent molecular abundances. We apply poseidon to the best transmission spectrum presently available, for the hot Jupiter HD 209458b, uncovering new insights into its atmosphere at the day-night terminator. We extensively explore the parameter space with an unprecedented 108 models, spanning the continuum from fully cloudy to cloud-free atmospheres, in a fully Bayesian retrieval framework. We report the first detection of nitrogen chemistry (NH3 and/or HCN) in an exoplanet atmosphere at 3.7-7.7σ confidence, non-uniform cloud coverage at 4.5-5.4σ, high-altitude hazes at {\textgreater}3σ and sub-solar H2O at ≳3-5σ, depending on the assumed cloud distribution. We detect NH3 at 3.3σ, and 4.9σ for fully cloudy and cloud-free scenarios, respectively. For the model with the highest Bayesian evidence, we constrain H2O at 5-15 ppm (0.01-0.03) × solar and NH3 at 0.01-2.7 ppm, strongly suggesting disequilibrium chemistry and cautioning against equilibrium assumptions. Our results herald a new promise for retrieving cloudy atmospheres using high-precision Hubble Space Telescope and James Webb Space Telescope spectra.},

Some giant planets, however, are thought to be hot enough to avoid condensation altogether5,6. Here we report the near-ultraviolet transmission spectrum of the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-178b (approximately 2,450 K), which exhibits substantial absorption. Bayesian retrievals indicate the presence of gaseous refractory species containing silicon and magnesium, which are the precursors to condensate clouds at lower temperatures. SiO, in particular, has not previously, to our knowledge, been detected in exoplanets, but the presence of SiO in WASP-178b is consistent with theoretical expectations as the dominant Si-bearing species at high temperatures. These observations allow us to re-interpret previous observations of HAT-P-41b and WASP-121b that did not consider SiO, to suggest that silicate cloud formation begins on exoplanets with equilibrium temperatures between 1,950 and 2,450 K.},

A recent study proposed that this unusual chemistry could be explained if the planet's atmosphere is significantly enhanced in elements heavier than hydrogen and helium. Here we report observations of GJ 436b's atmosphere obtained during transit. The data indicate that the planet's transmission spectrum is featureless, ruling out cloud-free, hydrogen-dominated atmosphere models with an extremely high significance of 48σ.

Here, I present the main conclusions from a comprehensive atmospheric retrieval survey of eight hot Jupiters with detectable molecular absorption in their near-infrared transmission spectra. I analyze the eight transmission spectra using the newly-developed, self-consistent atmospheric retrieval framework, SCARLET. Unlike previous methods, SCARLET combines the physical and chemical consistency of complex atmospheric models with the statistical treatment of observational uncertainties known from atmospheric retrieval techniques. I find that all eight hot Jupiters consistently require carbon-to-oxygen ratios (C/O) below 0.9. The finding of C/O{\textless}0.9 is highly robust for HD209458b, WASP-12b, WASP-19b, HAT-P-1b, and XO-1b. For HD189733b, WASP-17b, and WASP-43b, I find that the published WFC3 transmission spectra favor C/O{\textless}0.9 at greater than 95\% confidence. I further show that the water abundances on all eight hot Jupiters are consistent with solar composition. The relatively small depth of the detected water absorption features is due to the presence of clouds, not due to a low water abundance as previously suggested for HD209458b. The presence of a thick cloud deck is inferred for HD209458b and WASP-12b. HD189733b may host a similar cloud deck, rather than the previously suggested Rayleigh hazes, if star spots affect the observed spectrum. The approach taken in SCARLET can be regarded as a new pathway to interpreting spectral observations of planetary atmospheres. In this work, including our prior knowledge of H-C-N-O chemistry enables me to constrain the C/O ratio without detecting a single carbon-bearing molecule.},

	abstract = {Transmission spectroscopy is still the preferred characterization technique for exoplanet atmospheres, although it presents unique challenges which translate into characterization bottlenecks when robust mitigation strategies are missing. Stellar contamination is one of such challenges that can overpower the planetary signal by up to an order of magnitude, and thus not accounting for stellar contamination can lead to significant biases in the derived atmospheric properties. Yet, accounting for stellar contamination may not be straightforward, as important discrepancies exist between state-of-the-art stellar models and measured spectra and between models themselves. Here we explore the extent to which stellar models can be used to reliably correct for stellar contamination and yield a planet's uncontaminated transmission spectrum. We find that (1) discrepancies between stellar models can dominate the noise budget of JWST transmission spectra of planets around stars with heterogeneous photospheres; (2) the true number of unique photospheric spectral components and their properties can only be accurately retrieved when the stellar models have a sufficient fidelity; and (3) under such optimistic circumstances the contribution of stellar contamination to the noise budget of a transmission spectrum is considerably below that of the photon noise for the standard transit observation setup. Therefore, we suggest (1) increased efforts towards development of model spectra of stars and their active regions in a data-driven manner; and (2) the development of empirical approaches for deriving spectra of photospheric components using the observatories with which the atmospheric explorations are carried out.},

They span a range of low masses and temperatures relative to solar-type stars, facilitating molecule formation throughout their atmospheres.

Here, we introduce SPHINX—a new 1D self-consistent radiative–convective thermochemical equilibrium chemistry model grid of atmospheres and spectra for M dwarfs in low resolution (R ∼ 250). We incorporate the latest precomputed absorption cross sections with pressure broadening for key molecules dominant in late-K, early/main-sequence-M stars. We then validate our grid models by determining fundamental properties (T eff, log g, [M/H], radius, and C/O) for 10 benchmark M+G binary stars with known host metallicities and 10 M dwarfs with interferometrically measured angular diameters. Incorporating the Gaussian process inference tool Starfish, we account for correlated and systematic noise in low-resolution (spectral stitching of SpeX, SNIFS, and STIS) observations and derive robust estimates of fundamental M-dwarf atmospheric parameters. Additionally, we assess the influence of photospheric heterogeneity on inferred [M/H] and find that it could explain some deviations from observations. We also probe whether the adopted convective mixing length parameter influences inferred radii, effective temperature, and [M/H] and again find that may explain discrepancies between interferometric observations and model-derived parameters for cooler M dwarfs. Mainly, we show the unique strength in leveraging broadband molecular absorption features occurring in low-resolution M dwarf spectra and demonstrate the ability to improve constraints on fundamental properties of exoplanet hosts and brown-dwarf companions.},

	abstract = {The spectra of brown dwarfs are key to exploring the chemistry and physics that take place in their atmospheres. Late-T dwarf spectra are particularly diagnostic, due to their relatively cloud-free atmospheres and deep molecular bands. With the use of powerful atmospheric retrieval tools applied to the spectra of these objects, direct constraints on molecular/atomic abundances, gravity, and vertical thermal profiles can be obtained, enabling a broad exploration of the chemical/physical mechanisms operating in their atmospheres. We present a uniform retrieval analysis on low-resolution Infrared Telescope Facility SpeX near-infrared spectra for a sample of 50 T dwarfs, including new observations as part of a recent volume-limited survey. This analysis more than quadruples the sample of T dwarfs with retrieved temperature profiles and abundances (H2O, CH4, NH3, K, and subsequent C/O and metallicities). We are generally able to constrain the effective temperatures to within 50 K, the volume mixing ratios for major species to within 0.25 dex, the atmospheric metallicities [M/H] to within 0.2, and the C/O ratios to within 0.2. We compare our retrieved constraints on the thermal structures, chemistry, and gravities of these objects with predictions from self-consistent radiative-convective equilibrium models and find, in general, though with substantial scatter, consistency with solar composition chemistry and the thermal profiles of the neighboring stellar FGK population. Objects with notable discrepancies between the two modeling techniques and potential mechanisms for their differences, be they related to the modeling approach or physically motivated, are discussed more thoroughly in the text.},

	abstract = {Lyman α transits have been detected from several nearby exoplanets and are one of our best insights into the atmospheric escape process. However, due to ISM absorption, we typically only observe the transit signature in the blue-wing, making them challenging to interpret. This challenge has been recently highlighted by non-detections from planets thought to be undergoing vigorous escape. Pioneering 3D simulations have shown that escaping hydrogen is shaped into a cometary tail receding from the planet. Motivated by this work, we develop a simple model to interpret Lyman α transits. Using this framework, we show that the Lyman α transit depth is primarily controlled by the properties of the stellar tidal field rather than details of the escape process. Instead, the transit duration provides a direct measurement of the velocity of the planetary outflow. This result arises because the underlying physics is the distance a neutral hydrogen atom can travel before it is photoionized in the outflow. Thus, higher irradiation levels, expected to drive more powerful outflows, produce weaker, shorter Lyman α transits because the outflowing gas is ionized more quickly. Our framework suggests that the generation of energetic neutral atoms may dominate the transit signature early, but the acceleration of planetary material produces long tails. Thus, Lyman α transits do not primarily probe the mass-loss rates. Instead, they inform us about the velocity at which the escape mechanism is ejecting material from the planet, providing a clean test of predictions from atmospheric escape models.},

We investigate constraints on atmospheric abundances of H2O, Na, and K, in a sample of transiting exoplanets using the latest transmission spectra and new H2 broadened opacities of Na and K. Our sample of 19 exoplanets spans from cool mini-Neptunes to hot Jupiters, with equilibrium temperatures between ∼300 and 2700 K. Using homogeneous Bayesian retrievals we report atmospheric abundances of Na, K, and H2O, and their detection significances, confirming 6 planets with strong Na detections, 6 with K, and 14 with H2O. We find a mass-metallicity trend of increasing H2O abundances with decreasing mass, spanning generally substellar values for gas giants and stellar/superstellar for Neptunes and mini-Neptunes. However, the overall trend in H2O abundances, from mini-Neptunes to hot Jupiters, is significantly lower than the mass-metallicity relation for carbon in the solar system giant planets and similar predictions for exoplanets. On the other hand, the Na and K abundances for the gas giants are stellar or superstellar, consistent with each other, and generally consistent with the solar system metallicity trend. The H2O abundances in hot gas giants are likely due to low oxygen abundances relative to other elements rather than low overall metallicities, and provide new constraints on their formation mechanisms. The differing trends in the abundances of species argue against the use of chemical equilibrium models with metallicity as one free parameter in atmospheric retrievals, as different elements can be differently enhanced.},

However, the water content of the solar system giant planets is not well known because water is sequestered in clouds deep in their atmospheres. By contrast, short-period exoplanets have such high temperatures that their atmospheres have water in the gas phase, making it possible to measure the water abundance for these objects. We present a precise determination of the water abundance in the atmosphere of the 2 M Jup short-period exoplanet WASP-43b based on thermal emission and transmission spectroscopy measurements obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope. We find the water content is consistent with the value expected in a solar composition gas at planetary temperatures (0.4-3.5 × solar at 1σ confidence).

Cloud and haze opacity at the day-night planetary terminator are considered to be responsible for obscuring the absorption-line wings, which hinders constraints on absolute atmospheric abundances7-9. Here we report an optical transmission spectrum for the `hot Saturn' exoplanet WASP-96b obtained with the Very Large Telescope, which exhibits the complete pressure-broadened profile of the sodium absorption feature. The spectrum is in excellent agreement with cloud-free, solar-abundance models assuming chemical equilibrium. We are able to measure a precise, absolute sodium abundance of logɛNa = 6.9-0.4+0.6, and use it as a proxy for the planet's atmospheric metallicity relative to the solar value (Zp/Zʘ = 2.3-1.7+8.9).

Alkali metals have long been suggested to exhibit broad wings due to pressure broadening, but most of the alkali detections only show very narrow absorption cores, probably because of the presence of clouds. We report the strong detection of the pressure-broadened spectral profiles of Na, K, and Li absorption in the atmosphere of the super-Neptune WASP-127b, at 4.1σ, 5.0σ, and 3.4σ, respectively. We performed a spectral retrieval modeling on the high-quality optical transmission spectrum newly acquired with the 10.4 m Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC), in combination with the re-analyzed optical transmission spectrum obtained with the 2.5 m Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT). By assuming a patchy cloudy model, we retrieved the abundances of Na, K, and Li, which are super-solar at 3.7σ for K and 5.1σ for Li (and only 1.8σ for Na). We constrained the presence of haze coverage to be around 52\%. We also found a hint of water absorption, but cannot constrain it with the global retrieval owing to larger uncertainties in the probed wavelengths.

Searches for helium, however, have hitherto been unsuccessful2. Here we report observations of helium on an exoplanet, at a confidence level of 4.5 standard deviations. We measured the near-infrared transmission spectrum of the warm gas giant3 WASP-107b and identified the narrow absorption feature of excited metastable helium at 10,833 angstroms. The amplitude of the feature, in transit depth, is 0.049 ± 0.011 per cent in a bandpass of 98 angstroms, which is more than five times greater than what could be caused by nominal stellar chromospheric activity. This large absorption signal suggests that WASP-107b has an extended atmosphere that is eroding at a total rate of 1010 to 3 × 1011 grams per second (0.1-4 per cent of its total mass per billion years), and may have a comet-like tail of gas shaped by radiation pressure.},

	abstract = {Previous measurements of heat redistribution efficiency (the ability to transport energy from a planet’s highly irradiated dayside to its eternally dark nightside) show considerable variation between exoplanets. Theoretical models predict a positive correlation between heat redistribution efficiency and temperature for tidally locked planets; however, recent Hubble Space Telescope (HST) WASP-43b spectroscopic phase curve results are inconsistent with current predictions. Using the Spitzer Space Telescope, we obtained a total of three phase curve observations of WASP-43b (P = 0.813 days) at 3.6 and 4.5 μm. The first 3.6 μm visit exhibits spurious nightside emission that requires invoking unphysical conditions in our cloud-free atmospheric retrievals. The two other visits exhibit strong day-night contrasts that are consistent with the HST data. To reconcile the departure from theoretical predictions, WASP-43b would need to have a high-altitude, nightside cloud/haze layer blocking its thermal emission. Clouds/hazes could be produced within the planet’s cool, nearly retrograde mid-latitude flows before dispersing across its nightside at high altitudes. Since mid-latitude flows only materialize in fast-rotating (≲ 1 day) planets, this may explain an observed trend connecting measured day-night contrast with planet rotation rate that matches all current Spitzer phase curve results. Combining independent planetary emission measurements from multiple phases, we obtain a precise dayside hemisphere H2O abundance (2.5× \{10\}-5\{--\}1.1× \{10\}-4 at 1σ confidence) and, assuming chemical equilibrium and a scaled solar abundance pattern, we derive a corresponding metallicity estimate that is consistent with being solar (0.4-1.7). Using the retrieved global CO+CO2 abundance under the same assumptions, we estimate a comparable metallicity of 0.3-1.7× solar. This is the first time that precise abundance and metallicity constraints have been determined from multiple molecular tracers for a transiting exoplanet.},

Because WASP-43b receives a similar stellar flux as HD 209458b but has a rotation rate four times faster and a higher gravity, studying WASP-43b probes the effect of rotation rate and gravity on the circulation when stellar irradiation is held approximately constant. Here we present three-dimensional (3D) atmospheric circulation models of WASP-43b, exploring the effects of composition, metallicity, and frictional drag. We find that the circulation regime of WASP-43b is not unlike other hot Jupiters, with equatorial superrotation that yields an eastward-shifted hotspot and large day-night temperature variations ({\textasciitilde}600 K at photospheric pressures). We then compare our model results to Hubble Space Telescope (HST)/WFC3 spectrophotometric phase curve measurements of WASP-43b from 1.12 to 1.65 μm. Our results show the 5× solar model light curve provides a good match to the data, with a peak flux phase offset and planet/star flux ratio that is similar to observations; however, the model nightside appears to be brighter. Nevertheless, our 5× solar model provides an excellent match to the WFC3 dayside emission spectrum. This is a major success, as the result is a natural outcome of the 3D dynamics with no model tuning. These results demonstrate that 3D circulation models can help interpret exoplanet atmospheric observations, even at high resolution, and highlight the potential for future observations with HST, James Webb Space Telescope, and other next-generation telescopes.},

The phase-resolved spectra are consistent with blackbodies in the WFC3 bandpass, with brightness temperatures ranging from 1880 ± 40 K on the nightside to 2930 ± 40 K on the dayside. The dayside spectrum has a significantly higher brightness temperature in the Spitzer bands, likely due to CO emission and a thermal inversion. The inversion is not present on the nightside. We retrieved the atmospheric composition and found that it is moderately metal-enriched ([\{\{M\}\}/\{\{H\}\}]=\{23\}-13+29× \{solar\}) and the carbon-to-oxygen ratio is below 0.9 at 3σ confidence. In contrast to cooler hot Jupiters, we do not detect spectral features from water, which we attribute to partial H2O dissociation. We compare the phase curves to 3D general circulation models and find that magnetic drag effects are needed to match the data. We also compare the WASP-103b spectra to brown dwarfs and young, directly imaged companions. We find that these objects have significantly larger water features, indicating that surface gravity and irradiation environment play an important role in shaping the spectra of hot Jupiters. These results highlight the 3D structure of exoplanet atmospheres and illustrate the importance of phase curve observations for understanding their complex chemistry and physics.},

	abstract = {Transmission spectroscopy of exoplanets has the potential to provide precise measurements of atmospheric chemical abundances, in particular of hot Jupiters whose large sizes and high temperatures make them conducive to such observations. To date, several transmission spectra of hot Jupiters have revealed low amplitude features of water vapour compared to expectations from cloud-free atmospheres of solar metallicity. The low spectral amplitudes in such atmospheres could either be due to the presence of aerosols that obscure part of the atmosphere or due to inherently low abundances of H2O in the atmospheres. A recent survey of transmission spectra of ten hot Jupiters used empirical metrics to suggest atmospheres with a range of cloud/haze properties but with no evidence for H2O depletion. Here, we conduct a detailed and homogeneous atmospheric retrieval analysis of the entire sample and report the H2O abundances, cloud properties, terminator temperature profiles, and detection significances of the chemical species. This study finds that the majority of hot Jupiters have atmospheres consistent with subsolar H2O abundances at their day-night terminators. The best constrained abundances range from log(H2O) of -5.04{\textasciicircum}\{+0.46\}\_\{-0.30\} to -3.16{\textasciicircum}\{+0.66\}\_\{-0.69\}, which compared to expectations from solar-abundance equilibrium chemistry correspond to 0.018{\textasciicircum}\{+0.035\}\_\{-0.009\}× solar to 1.40{\textasciicircum}\{+4.97\}\_\{-1.11\}× solar. Besides H2O we report statistical constraints on other chemical species and cloud/haze properties, including cloud/haze coverage fractions which range from 0.18{\textasciicircum}\{+0.26\}\_\{-0.12\} to 0.76{\textasciicircum}\{+0.13\}\_\{-0.15\}. The retrieved H2O abundances suggest subsolar oxygen and/or supersolar C/O ratios, and can provide important constraints on the formation and migration pathways of hot giant exoplanets.},

HAT-P-1b has solutions that fall into both categories. WASP-6b, HAT-P-12b, HD 189733b, and WASP-12b must have aerosol extending to low atmospheric pressures (below 0.1 mbar). In general, planets with equilibrium temperatures between 1300 and 1700 K are best represented by deeper, gray cloud layers, whereas cooler or hotter planets are better fit using high Rayleigh scattering aerosol. We find little evidence for the presence of molecular absorbers other than H2O. Retrieval methods can provide a consistent picture across a range of hot Jupiter atmospheres with existing data, and will be a powerful tool for the interpretation of James Webb Space Telescope observations.},

Here we present an analysis of this spectrum. We develop first-order equations to interpret absorption spectra. In the case of HD 189733b, we show that the observed slope of the absorption as a function of wavelength is characteristic of extinction proportional to the inverse of the fourth power of the wavelength (). Assuming an extinction dominated by Rayleigh scattering, we derive an atmospheric temperature of 1340 {\textless}i{\textgreater}±{\textless}i/{\textgreater} 150 K. If molecular hydrogen is responsible for the Rayleigh scattering, the atmospheric pressure at the planetary characteristic radius of 0.1564 stellar radius must be 410 {\textless}i{\textgreater}±{\textless}i/{\textgreater} 30 mbar. However the preferred scenario is scattering by condensate particles. Using the Mie approximation, we find that the particles must have a low value for the imaginary part of the refraction index. We identify MgSiO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}3{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} as a possible abundant condensate whose particle size must be between {\textasciitilde}10{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-2{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} and {\textasciitilde}10{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} {\textless}i{\textgreater}μ{\textless}i/{\textgreater}m. For this condensate, assuming solar abundance, the pressure at 0.1564 stellar radius is found to be between a few microbars and few millibars, and the temperature is found to be in the range 1340–1540 K, and both depend on the particle size.},

	abstract = {Exoplanetary transmission spectroscopy in the near-infrared using the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) NICMOS is currently ambiguous because different observational groups claim different results from the same data, depending on their analysis methodologies. Spatial scanning with HST/WFC3 provides an opportunity to resolve this ambiguity. We here report WFC3 spectroscopy of the giant planets HD 209458b and XO-1b in transit, using spatial scanning mode for maximum photon-collecting efficiency. We introduce an analysis technique that derives the exoplanetary transmission spectrum without the necessity of explicitly decorrelating instrumental effects, and achieves nearly photon-limited precision even at the high flux levels collected in spatial scan mode. Our errors are within 6\% (XO-1) and 26\% (HD 209458b) of the photon-limit at a resolving power of λ/δλ {\textasciitilde} 70, and are better than 0.01\% per spectral channel. Both planets exhibit water absorption of approximately 200 ppm at the water peak near 1.38 μm. Our result for XO-1b contradicts the much larger absorption derived from NICMOS spectroscopy. The weak water absorption we measure for HD 209458b is reminiscent of the weakness of sodium absorption in the first transmission spectroscopy of an exoplanet atmosphere by Charbonneau et al. Model atmospheres having uniformly distributed extra opacity of 0.012 cm2 g-1 account approximately for both our water measurement and the sodium absorption. Our results for HD 209458b support the picture advocated by Pont et al. in which weak molecular absorptions are superposed on a transmission spectrum that is dominated by continuous opacity due to haze and/or dust. However, the extra opacity needed for HD 209458b is grayer than for HD 189733b, with a weaker Rayleigh component.},

	abstract = {Detailed characterization of exoplanets has begun to yield measurements of their atmospheric properties that constrain the planets’ origins and evolution. For example, past observations of the dayside emission spectrum of the hot Jupiter WASP-12b indicated that its atmosphere has a high carbon-to-oxygen ratio (C/O {\textgreater} 1), suggesting it had a different formation pathway than is commonly assumed for giant planets. Here we report a precise near-infrared transmission spectrum for WASP-12b based on six transit observations with the Hubble Space Telescope/Wide Field Camera 3. We bin the data in 13 spectrophotometric light curves from 0.84 to 1.67 μm and measure the transit depths to a median precision of 51 ppm. We retrieve the atmospheric properties using the transmission spectrum and find strong evidence for water absorption (7σ confidence). This detection marks the first high-confidence, spectroscopic identification of a molecule in the atmosphere of WASP-12b. The retrieved 1 σ water volume mixing ratio is between 10-5 and 10-2, which is consistent with C/O {\textgreater} 1 to within 2σ. However, we also introduce a new retrieval parameterization that fits for C/O and metallicity under the assumption of chemical equilibrium. With this approach, we constrain C/O to \{0.5\}-0.3+0.2 at 1σ and rule out a carbon-rich atmosphere composition (C/O {\textgreater} 1) at {\textgreater}3σ confidence. Further observations and modeling of the planet’s global thermal structure and dynamics would aid in resolving the tension between our inferred C/O and previous constraints. Our findings highlight the importance of obtaining high-precision data with multiple observing techniques in order to obtain robust constraints on the chemistry and physics of exoplanet atmospheres.},

This model grid has been developed using a 1D radiative-convective-chemical equilibrium model termed ATMO, with up-to-date high-temperature opacities. We present an interpretation of observations of 10 exoplanets, including best-fitting parameters and χ2 maps. In agreement with previous works, we find a continuum from clear to hazy/cloudy atmospheres for this sample of hot Jupiters. The data for all the 10 planets are consistent with subsolar to solar C/O ratio, 0.005 to 10 times solar metallicity and water rather than methane-dominated infrared spectra. We then explore the range of simulated atmospheric spectra for different exoplanets, based on characteristics such as temperature, metallicity, C/O ratio, haziness and cloudiness. We find a transition value for the metallicity between 10 and 50 times solar, which leads to substantial changes in the transmission spectra. We also find a transition value of C/O ratio, from water to carbon species dominated infrared spectra, as found by previous works, revealing a temperature dependence of this transition point ranging from ∼0.56 to ∼1-1.3 for equilibrium temperatures from ∼900 to ∼2600 K. We highlight the potential of the spectral features of HCN and C2H2 to constrain the metallicities and C/O ratios of planets, using James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations.

Here we investigate alternative methods of sampling parameters, including random sampling and Latin hypercube (LH) sampling, and how these compare to linearly sampled grids. We use a random forest to analyze the performance of these grids for two different models, as well as investigate the information content of the particular model grid from Goyal et al. (2019). We also use nested sampling to implement mock atmospheric retrievals on simulated James Webb Space Telescope transmission spectra by interpolating on linearly sampled model grids. Our results show that random or LH sampling outperforms linear sampling in parameter predictability for our higher-dimensional models, requiring fewer models in the grid, and thus allowing for more computationally intensive forward models to be used. We also found that using a traditional retrieval with interpolation on a linear grid can produce biased posterior distributions, especially for parameters with nonlinear effects on the spectrum. In particular, we advise caution when performing linear interpolation on the C/O ratio, cloud properties, and metallicity. Finally, we found that the information content analysis of the grid from Goyal et al. (2019) was able to highlight key areas of the spectra where the presence or absence of certain molecules can be detected, providing good indicators for parameters such as temperature and C/O ratio.},

We used the Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 (HST WFC3) with its G141 grism covering 1.1 μm to 1.7 μm and spatially scanned the image across the detector at 2″ s−1. When smoothed to 75 nm bins, the local maxima of the transit depths in the 1.15 μm and 1.4 μm water vapor features are, respectively, 83 ± 53 ppm and 200 ± 47 ppm greater than the local minimum at 1.3 μm. We compare the WFC3 spectrum with the composite transit spectrum of HD 189733b assembled by Pont et al., extending from 0.3 μm to 24 μm. Although the water vapor features in the WFC3 spectrum are compatible with the model of non-absorbing, Rayleigh-scattering dust in the planetary atmosphere, we also re-interpret the available data with a clear planetary atmosphere. In the latter interpretation, the slope of increasing transit depth with shorter wavelengths from the near infrared, through the visible, and into the ultraviolet is caused by unocculted star spots, with a smaller contribution of Rayleigh scattering by molecular hydrogen in the planet's atmosphere. At relevant pressures along the terminator, our model planetary atmosphere's temperature is ∼700 K, which is below the condensation temperatures of sodium- and potassium-bearing molecules, causing the broad wings of the spectral lines of Na i and K i at 0.589 μm and 0.769 μm to be weak.},

Currently mostly on the instrumental side, characterization bottlenecks will soon appear at the models used to translate spectra into atmospheric properties. Limitations stemming from our stellar and atmospheric models have already been highlighted. Here, we show that the current limitations of the opacity models used to decode exoplanet spectra propagate into an accuracy wall at {\textasciitilde}0.5-1.0 dex (that is, three- to tenfold) on the atmospheric properties, which is an order of magnitude above the precision targeted by James Webb Space Telescope Cycle 1 programmes and needed, for example, for meaningful C/O-ratio constraints and biosignature identification. We perform a sensitivity analysis using nine different opacity models and find that most of the retrievals produce harmonious fits owing to compensations in the form of {\textgreater}5σ biases on the derived atmospheric parameters translating into the aforementioned accuracy wall. We suggest a two-tier approach to alleviate this problem, involving a new retrieval procedure and guided improvements in opacity data, their standardization and optimal dissemination.},

	abstract = {We go through the many considerations involved in fitting a model to data, using as an example the fit of a straight line to a set of points in a two-dimensional plane. Standard weighted least-squares fitting is only appropriate when there is a dimension along which the data points have negligible uncertainties, and another along which all the uncertainties can be described by Gaussians of known variance; these conditions are rarely met in practice. We consider cases of general, heterogeneous, and arbitrarily covariant two-dimensional uncertainties, and situations in which there are bad data (large outliers), unknown uncertainties, and unknown but expected intrinsic scatter in the linear relationship being fit. Above all we emphasize the importance of having a "generative model" for the data, even an approximate one. Once there is a generative model, the subsequent fitting is non-arbitrary because the model permits direct computation of the likelihood of the parameters or the posterior probability distribution. Construction of a posterior probability distribution is indispensible if there are "nuisance parameters" to marginalize away.},

	abstract = {Ultra-hot Jupiters are perfect targets for transmission spectroscopy. However, their atmospheres feature strong spatial variations in temperature, chemistry, dynamics, cloud coverage, and scale height. This makes transit observations at high spectral resolution challenging to interpret. In this work, we model the cross-correlation signal of five chemical species (Fe, CO, H\$\_{\textbackslash}text\{2\}\$O, OH, and TiO) on WASP-76b, a benchmark ultra-hot Jupiter. We compute phase-dependent high-resolution transmission spectra of 3D SPARC/MITgcm models. The spectra are obtained with gCMCRT, a 3D Monte-Carlo radiative-transfer code. We find that, on top of atmospheric dynamics, the phase-dependent Doppler shift of the absorption lines in the planetary rest frame is shaped by the combined effect of planetary rotation and the unique 3D spatial distribution of chemical species. For species probing the dayside (e.g., refractories or molecules like CO and OH), the two effects act in tandem, leading to increasing blueshifts with orbital phase. For species that are depleted on the dayside (e.g., H\$\_{\textbackslash}text\{2\}\$O and TiO), the two effects act in an opposite manner, and could lead to increasing redshifts during the transit. This behaviour yields species-dependent offsets from a planet's expected \$K\_{\textbackslash}text\{p\}\$ value that can be much larger than planetary wind speeds. The offsets are usually negative for refractory species. We provide an analytical formula to estimate the size of a planet's \$K\_{\textbackslash}text\{p\}\$ offsets, which can serve as a prior for atmospheric retrievals. We conclude that observing the phase-resolved absorption signal of multiple species is key to constraining the 3D thermochemical structure and dynamics of ultra-hot Jupiters.},

	abstract = {Earth-like planets orbiting M-dwarf stars, M-Earths, are currently the best targets to search for signatures of life. Life as we know it requires water. The habitability of M-Earths is jeopardized by water loss to space: high flux from young M-dwarf stars can drive the loss of 3--20 Earth oceans from otherwise habitable planets. We develop a 0-D box model for Earth-mass terrestrial exoplanets, orbiting within the habitable zone, which tracks water loss to space and exchange between reservoirs during an early surface magma ocean phase and the longer deep-water cycling phase. A key feature is the duration of the surface magma ocean, assumed concurrent with the runaway greenhouse. This timescale can discriminate between desiccated planets, planets with desiccated mantles but substantial surface water, and planets with significant water sequestered in the mantle. A longer-lived surface magma ocean helps M-Earths retain water: dissolution of water in the magma provides a barrier against significant loss to space during the earliest, most active stage of the host M-dwarf, depending on the water saturation limit of the magma. Although a short-lived basal magma ocean can be beneficial to surface habitability, a long-lived basal magma ocean may sequester significant water in the mantle at the detriment of surface habitability. We find that magma oceans and deep-water cycling can maintain or recover habitable surface conditions on Earth-like planets at the inner edge of the habitable zone around late M-dwarf stars -- these planets would otherwise be desiccated if they form with less than \$\{{\textbackslash}sim\}\$10 terrestrial oceans of water.},

	abstract = {Techniques to retrieve the atmospheric properties of exoplanets via direct observation of their reflected light have often been limited in scope due to computational constraints imposed by the forward-model calculations. We have developed a new set of techniques which significantly decreases the time required to perform a retrieval while maintaining accurate results. We constructed a grid of 1.4 million pre-computed geometric albedo spectra valued at discrete sets of parameter points. Spectra from this grid are used to produce models for a fast and efficient nested sampling routine called PSGnest. Beyond the upfront time to construct a spectral grid, the amount of time to complete a full retrieval using PSGnest is on the order of seconds to minutes using a personal computer. An extensive evaluation of the error induced from interpolating intermediate spectra from the grid indicates that this bias is insignificant compared to other retrieval error sources, with an average coefficient of determination between interpolated and true spectra of 0.998. We apply these new retrieval techniques to help constrain the optimal bandpass centers for retrieving various atmospheric and bulk parameters from a LuvEx-type mission observing several planetary archetypes. We show that spectral observations made using a 20{\textbackslash}\% bandpass centered at 0.73 microns can be used alongside our new techniques to make detections of \$H\_2O\$ and \$O\_2\$ without the need to increase observing time beyond what is necessary for a signal-to-noise ratio of 10.

Vigorous convection within their metallic cores may produce dynamos and thus magnetospheres if the total heat flow out of the core exceeds a critical value. Earth has a core-hosted dynamo because plate tectonics cools the core relatively rapidly. In contrast, Venus has no dynamo and its deep interior probably cools slowly. Here, we develop scaling laws for how planetary mass affects the minimum heat flow required to sustain both thermal and chemical convection, which we compare to a simple model for the actual heat flow conveyed by solid-state mantle convection. We found that the required heat flows increase with planetary mass (to a power of ∼0.8–0.9), but the actual heat flow may increase even faster (to a power of ∼1.6). Massive super-Earths are likely to host a dynamo in their metallic cores if their silicate mantles are entirely solid. Super-Venuses with relatively slow mantle convection could host a dynamo if their mass exceeds ∼1.5 (with an inner core) or ∼4 (without an inner core) Earth-masses. However, the mantles of massive rocky exoplanets might not be completely solid. Basal magma oceans may reduce the heat flow across the core-mantle boundary and smother any core-hosted dynamo. Detecting a magnetosphere at an Earth-mass planet probably signals Earth-like geodynamics. In contrast, magnetic fields may not reliably reveal if a massive exoplanet is a super-Earth or a super-Venus. We eagerly await direct observations in the next few decades.},

Venus has a relatively hot interior that cools slowly in the absence of plate tectonics, which reduces heat flow through the solid mantle. Consequentially, the basal magma ocean could remain as thick as 200–400 km today. Vigorous convection of liquid silicates could power a global magnetic field until recently while a core-hosted dynamo is suppressed.

	abstract = {Most of the large rocky bodies in the solar system display evidence of past and/or current magnetic activity, driven by thermochemical convection in an electrically conducting fluid layer. The discovery of a large number of extrasolar planets motivates the search for magnetic fields beyond the solar system. While current observations are limited to providing planetary radii and minimum masses, studying the evolution of exoplanets' magnetic fields and their interaction with the atmosphere can open new avenues for constraining interior properties from future atmospheric observations. Here, we investigate the evolution of massive rocky planets (0.8 − 2 MEarth) with different bulk and mantle iron contents. Starting from their temperature profiles after accretion, we determine the structure of the core and model its subsequent thermal and magnetic evolution over 5 Gyr. We find that the planetary iron inventory and distribution strongly affect core structure, evolution, and the lifetime of a magnetic field. Planets with large bulk and mantle iron contents tend to feature large solid inner cores, which can grow up to the liquid outer core radius, shutting down any pre-existing magnetic activity. Consequently, the longest dynamo lifetimes (∼ 4.25 Gyr) are obtained for massive planets with intermediate iron inventories. The smaller inner core radii and the chemical buoyancy fluxes introduced by the presence of light impurities can extend the magnetic field lifetimes to more than 5 Gyr. While the calculated magnetic fields are too weak to be detected by ground facilities, indirect observations may provide valuable insights into exoplanetary dynamos.},

Here we use numerical convection models to predict the longevity and heat flow of such a basal magma ocean and use scaling laws to estimate the resulting magnetic field strength.

	abstract = {Secondary eclipse observations of hot Jupiters can reveal both their compositions and thermal structures. Previous observations have shown a diversity of hot Jupiter eclipse spectra, including absorption features, emission features, and featureless blackbody-like spectra. We present a secondary eclipse spectrum of the hot Jupiter WASP-77Ab observed between 1 and 5 μm with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and the Spitzer Space Telescope. The HST observations show signs of water absorption indicative of a noninverted thermal structure. We fit the data with both a one-dimensional free retrieval and a grid of one-dimensional self-consistent forward models to confirm this noninverted structure. The free retrieval places a 3σ lower limit on the atmospheric water abundance of and cannot constrain the CO abundance. The grid fit produces a slightly superstellar metallicity and constrains the carbon-to-oxygen ratio to less than or equal to the solar value. We also compare our data to recent high-resolution observations of WASP-77Ab taken with the IGRINS/IGRINS spectrograph. We find that the best-fit model to the IGRINS data gives a reduced chi squared of χ2 ν = 1.32 when compared to the WFC3 data. However, the metallicity derived from the IGRINS data is significantly lower than that derived from our self-consistent model fit. We find that this difference may be due to disequilibrium chemistry, and the varying results between the models applied here demonstrate the model dependence of derived metallicities when comparing to low-resolution, low-wavelength coverage data alone. Future work to combine observations from IGRINS, HST, and the James Webb Space Telescope will improve our estimate of the atmospheric composition of WASP-77Ab.},

	abstract = {Reduced chi-squared is a very popular method for model assessment, model comparison, convergence diagnostic, and error estimation in astronomy. In this manuscript, we discuss the pitfalls involved in using reduced chi-squared. There are two independent problems: (a) The number of degrees of freedom can only be estimated for linear models. Concerning nonlinear models, the number of degrees of freedom is unknown, i.e., it is not possible to compute the value of reduced chi-squared. (b) Due to random noise in the data, also the value of reduced chi-squared itself is subject to noise, i.e., the value is uncertain. This uncertainty impairs the usefulness of reduced chi-squared for differentiating between models or assessing convergence of a minimisation procedure. The impact of noise on the value of reduced chi-squared is surprisingly large, in particular for small data sets, which are very common in astrophysical problems. We conclude that reduced chi-squared can only be used with due caution for linear models, whereas it must not be used for nonlinear models at all. Finally, we recommend more sophisticated and reliable methods, which are also applicable to nonlinear models.},

However, non-Gaussian noise can occur due to instrumental or stellar systematics and the merging of discrete data sets. We investigate the effect of correlated noise and constrain the potential biases incurred in the retrieved posteriors. We simulate multiple noise instances of synthetic data and perform retrievals to obtain statistics of the goodness of retrieval for varying noise models. We find that correlated noise allows for overfitting the spectrum, thereby yielding a better goodness of fit on average but degrading the overall accuracy of retrievals. In particular, correlated noise can manifest as an apparent non-Rayleigh slope in the optical range, leading to an incorrect estimate of cloud/haze parameters. We also find that higher precision causes correlated results to be further off from the input values in terms of estimated errors. Finally, we show that while correlated noise cannot be reliably distinguished with Hubble Space Telescope observations, inferring its presence and strength may be possible with James Webb Space Telescope observations. As such, we emphasize that caution must be taken in analyzing retrieved posteriors and that estimated parameter uncertainties are best understood as lower limits.},

This constraint can be computed explicitly using the entropy balance of the core and depends on the thermal conductivity, whose value has been revised upwardly. A high order model (fourth degree polynomial of the radial position) for the core structure is derived and the implications for the core cooling rate and thermal evolution obtained, using the recent values of the thermal conductivity. For a thermal conductivity increasing with depth as proposed by some of these recent studies, a CMB heat flow equal to the isentropic value (13.25TW at present) leads to a 700km thick layer at the top of the core where a downward convective heat flow is necessary to maintain an isentropic and well mixed average state. Considering a CMB heat flow larger than the well mixed isentropic value leads to an inner core less than 700Myr old and the thermal evolution of the core is largely constrained by the conditions for dynamo action without an inner core. Analytical calculations for that period show that a CMB temperature larger than 7000K must have prevailed 4.5Gyr ago if the geodynamo has been driven by thermal convection for that whole time. This raises questions regarding the onset of the geodynamo and its continuous operation for the last 3.5Gyr. Implications regarding the evolution of a basal magma ocean are also considered.},

	abstract = {Observations of Earth's magnetic field extending back to 3.45 billion years ago indicate that generation by a core dynamo must be sustained over most of Earth's history. However, recent estimates of thermal and electrical conductivity of liquid iron at core conditions from mineral physics experiments indicate that adiabatic heat flux is approximately 15 TW, nearly three times larger than previously thought, exacerbating difficulties for driving a core dynamo throughout Earth history by convective core cooling alone. Here, we explore the geomagnetic consequences of a basal magma ocean layer in the lowermost mantle, hypothesized to exist in the early Earth and perhaps surviving until well after the Archean. While the modern, solid lower mantle is an electromagnetic insulator, electrical conductivities of silicate melts are known to be higher, though as yet they are unconstrained for lowermost mantle conditions. We consider a range of possible electrical conductivities and find that for the highest electrical conductivities considered, a long-lived basal magma ocean could be a primary dynamo source region. This would suggest the proposed three magnetic eras observed in paleomagnetic data originate from distinct sources for dynamo generation: from 4.5 to 2.45 Ga within a basal magma ocean, from 2.25 to 0.4 Ga within a superadiabatically cooled liquid core, and from 0.4 Ga to present within a quasi-adiabatic core that includes a solidifying inner core.},

	abstract = {The Martian mantle probably experienced an early global magma ocean stage. The crystallization and the fractionation and overturn of such a magma ocean likely led to the formation of a compositionally distinct layer at the bottom of the mantle. This layer would have been heavily enriched in iron and in heat-producing elements (HPE). The significant iron enrichment can lead to long-term stability with little mixing between the layer and the overlying mantle. We studied the influence of such an enriched basal layer on the thermal and chemical evolution of the Martian mantle using both 2-D finite-volume modeling at mantle scale, and a parameterized convection approach at the entire planetary scale. The basal layer is most likely stably stratified because of its moderate thickness and/or its gradual enrichment in iron with depth that prevents the development of convection in this region. We explored a wide parameter space in our parameterized models, including the layer thickness and the mantle rheology. We show that the presence of an enriched basal layer has a dramatic influence on the thermo-chemical evolution of Mars, strongly delaying deep cooling, and significantly affecting nearly all present-day characteristics of the planet (heat flux, thermal state, crustal and lithospheric thickness, Love number and tidal dissipation). In particular, the enrichment of the layer in iron and HPE generates large volumes of stable melt near the core-mantle boundary. Due to their intrinsic low viscosity and seismic velocities, these regions of silicate melt could be erroneously interpreted as core material.},

	abstract = {Understanding planet formation requires robust population studies, which are designed to reveal trends in planet properties. In this work we aim to determine if and how different methods for selecting populations of exoplanets for atmospheric characterization with JWST could influence population-level inferences. We generate three hypothetical surveys of super-Earths/sub-Neptunes, with each survey designed to span a similar radius-insolation flux space. The survey samples are constructed based on three different selection criteria (evenly spaced by eye, binned, and a quantitative selection function). Using an injection-recovery technique, we test how robustly individual-planet atmospheric parameters and population-level parameters can be retrieved. We find that all three survey designs result in equally suitable targets for individual atmospheric characterization, but not equally suitable targets for constraining population parameters. Only samples constructed with a quantitative method or that are sufficiently evenly spaced-by-eye result in robust population parameter constraints. Furthermore, we find that the sample with the best targets for individual atmospheric study does not necessarily result in the best-constrained population parameters. The method of sample selection must be considered. We also find that there may be large variability in population-level results with a sample that is small enough to fit in a single JWST cycle (∼12 planets), suggesting that the most successful population-level analyses will be multicycle. Lastly, we infer that our exploration of sample selection is limited by the small number of transiting planets with measured masses around bright stars. Our results can guide future development of programs that aim to determine underlying trends in exoplanet-atmospheric properties, and, by extension, formation and evolution processes.},

The target, WASP-121b, is an ultrahot Jupiter with an orbital period of 30.6 hr. We analyze two broadband light curves generated for the NRS1 and NRS2 detectors, covering wavelength ranges of 2.70–3.72 μm and 3.82–5.15 μm, respectively. Both light curves exhibit minimal systematics, with approximately linear drifts in the baseline flux level of 30 ppm hr−1 (NRS1) and 10 ppm hr−1 (NRS2). Assuming a simple brightness map for the planet described by a low-order spherical harmonic dipole, our light-curve fits suggest that the phase curve peaks coincide with orbital phases 3.°36 ± 0.°11 (NRS1) and 2.°66 ± 0.°12 (NRS2) prior to mideclipse. This is consistent with the strongest dayside emission emanating from eastward of the substellar point. We measure planet-to-star emission ratios of 3924 ± 7 ppm (NRS1) and 4924 ± 9 ppm (NRS2) for the dayside hemisphere and 136 ± 8 ppm (NRS1) and 630 ± 10 ppm (NRS2) for the nightside hemisphere. The latter nightside emission ratios translate to planetary brightness temperatures of 926 ± 12 K (NRS1) and 1122 ± 10 K (NRS2), which are low enough for a wide range of refractory condensates to form, including enstatite and forsterite. A nightside cloud deck may be blocking emission from deeper, hotter layers of the atmosphere, potentially helping to explain why cloud-free 3D general circulation model simulations systematically overpredict the nightside emission for WASP-121b.},

Fundamental properties that may enable the link to exoplanet formation differ amongst retrieval methods, for example metallicity and mineral ratios. In this work, the formation of clouds in the atmosphere of WASP-39b is explored to investigate how inhomogeneous cloud properties (particle sizes, material composition, opacity) may be for this intermediately warm gaseous exoplanet. WASP-39b's atmosphere has a comparable day-night temperature median with sufficiently low temperatures that clouds may form globally. The presence of clouds on WASP-39b can explain observations without resorting to a high ({\textgreater} 100x solar) metallicity atmosphere for a reduced vertical mixing efficiency. The assessment of mineral ratios shows an under-depletion of S/O due to condensation compared to C/O, Mg/O, Si/O, Fe/O ratios. Vertical patchiness due to heterogeneous cloud composition challenges simple cloud models. An equal mixture of silicates and metal oxides is expected to characterise the cloud top. Further, optical properties of Fe and Mg silicates in the mid-infrared differ significantly which will impact the interpretation of JWST observations. We conclude that WASP-39b's atmosphere contains clouds and the underdepletion of S/O by atmospheric condensation processes suggest the use of sulphur gas species as a possible link to primordial element abundances. Over-simplified cloud models do not capture the complex nature of mixed-condensate clouds in exoplanet atmospheres. The clouds in the observable upper atmosphere of WASP-39b are a mixture of different silicates and metal oxides. The use of constant particles sizes and/or one-material cloud particles alone to interpret spectra may not be sufficient to capture the full complexity available through JWST observations.},

	abstract = {Context. The evolution of stars and planets is mostly controlled by the properties of their atmosphere. This is particularly true in the case of exoplanets close to their stars, for which one has to account both for an (often intense) irradiation flux, and from an intrinsic flux responsible for the progressive loss of the inner planetary heat. Aims: The goals of the present work are to help understanding the coupling between radiative transfer and advection in exoplanetary atmospheres and to provide constraints on the temperatures of the deep atmospheres. This is crucial in assessing whether modifying assumed opacity sources and/or heat transport may explain the inflated sizes of a significant number of giant exoplanets found so far. Methods: I use a simple analytical approach inspired by Eddington's approximation for stellar atmospheres to derive a relation between temperature and optical depth valid for plane-parallel static grey atmospheres which are both transporting an intrinsic heat flux and receiving an outer radiation flux. The model is parameterized as a function of mean visible and thermal opacities, respectively. Results: The model is shown to reproduce relatively well temperature profiles obtained from more sophisticated radiative transfer calculations of exoplanetary atmospheres. It naturally explains why a temperature inversion (stratosphere) appears when the opacity in the optical becomes significant compared to that in the infrared. I further show that the mean equivalent flux (proportional to T4) is conserved in the presence of horizontal advection on constant optical depth levels. This implies with these hypotheses that the deep atmospheric temperature used as outer boundary for the evolution models should be calculated from models pertaining to the entire planetary atmosphere, not from ones that are relevant to the day side or to the substellar point. In these conditions, present-day models yield deep temperatures that are {\textasciitilde}1000 K too cold to explain the present size of planet HD 209458b. An tenfold increase in the infrared to visible opacity ratio would be required to slow the planetary cooling and contraction sufficiently to explain its size. However, the mean equivalent flux is not conserved anymore in the presence of opacity variations, or in the case of non-radiative vertical transport of energy: The presence of clouds on the night side or a downward transport of kinetic energy and its dissipation at deep levels would help making the deep atmosphere hotter and may explain the inflated sizes of giant exoplanets.},

We designed tests using synthetic data to determine the best approach for retrieving L dwarf spectra, isolating the challenges in the absence of cloud opacity. We conducted atmospheric retrievals on synthetic cloud-free L dwarf spectra derived from the Sonora Bobcat models at SpeX resolution using a variety of thermal and chemical abundance profile parameterizations. For objects hotter than L5 (T eff {\textasciitilde} 1700 K), the limited pressure layers probed in the NIR are mostly convective; parameterized pressure-temperature (PT) profiles bias results and free, unsmoothed profiles should be used. Only when many layers both above and below the radiative-convective boundary are probed can parameterized profiles provide accurate results. Furthermore, a nonuniform abundance profile for FeH is needed to accurately retrieve bulk properties of early-to-mid L dwarfs. Nonuniform prescriptions for other gases in NIR retrievals may also be warranted near the L/T transition (CH4) and early Y dwarfs (Na and K). We demonstrate the utility of using realistic, self-consistent models to benchmark retrievals and suggest how they can be used in the future.},

	abstract = {The computation of transmission spectra is a central ingredient in the study of exoplanetary atmospheres. First, we revisit the theory of transmission spectra, unifying ideas from several workers in the literature. Transmission spectra lack an absolute normalization due to the a priori unknown value of a reference transit radius, which is tied to an unknown reference pressure. We show that there is a degeneracy between the uncertainty in the transit radius, the assumed value of the reference pressure (typically set to 10 bar) and the inferred value of the water abundance when interpreting a Wide-Field Camera 3 (WFC3) transmission spectrum. Secondly, we show that the transmission spectra of isothermal atmospheres are nearly isobaric. We validate the isothermal, isobaric analytical formula for the transmission spectrum against full numerical calculations and show that the typical errors are ∼0.1 per cent (∼10 ppm) within the WFC3 range of wavelengths for temperatures of 1500 K (or higher). Thirdly, we generalize the previous expression for the transit radius to include a small temperature gradient. Finally, we analyse the measured WFC3 transmission spectrum of WASP-12b and demonstrate that we obtain consistent results with the retrieval approach of Kreidberg et al., if the reference transit radius and reference pressure are fixed to assumed values. The unknown functional relationship between the reference transit radius and reference pressure implies that it is the product of the water abundance and reference pressure that is being retrieved from the data, and not just the water abundance alone. This degeneracy leads to a limitation on how accurately we may extract molecular abundances from transmission spectra using WFC3 data alone. We suggest an approximate expression for this relationship. Finally, we compare our study to that of Griffith and discuss why the degeneracy was missed in previous retrieval studies.},

However, no unambiguous photochemical products have been detected in exoplanet atmospheres so far. Recent observations from the JWST Transiting Exoplanet Community Early Release Science Program2,3 found a spectral absorption feature at 4.05 μm arising from sulfur dioxide (SO2) in the atmosphere of WASP-39b. WASP-39b is a 1.27-Jupiter-radii, Saturn-mass (0.28 MJ) gas giant exoplanet orbiting a Sun-like star with an equilibrium temperature of around 1,100 K (ref. 4). The most plausible way of generating SO2 in such an atmosphere is through photochemical processes5,6. Here we show that the SO2 distribution computed by a suite of photochemical models robustly explains the 4.05-μm spectral feature identified by JWST transmission observations7 with NIRSpec PRISM (2.7σ)8 and G395H (4.5σ)9. SO2 is produced by successive oxidation of sulfur radicals freed when hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is destroyed. The sensitivity of the SO2 feature to the enrichment of the atmosphere by heavy elements (metallicity) suggests that it can be used as a tracer of atmospheric properties, with WASP-39b exhibiting an inferred metallicity of about 10× solar. We further point out that SO2 also shows observable features at ultraviolet and thermal infrared wavelengths not available from the existing observations.},

	abstract = {The presence of a planetary magnetic field is an important ingredient for habitability. The coexistence of a solid and a liquid core can facilitate the maintenance of a compositionally driven dynamo; however, the likelihood of such a configuration in super-Earths is unknown. Recently, shock experiments and ab initio calculations have constrained the stability, equations of state, and melting properties of ultrahigh pressure core and mantle phases. Here, we investigate the internal structure of super-Earth exoplanets with a range of total masses and core mass fractions ranging from that of Mars (0.2) to Mercury (0.68), including an Earth-like bulk composition. We examine the effect of the initial core-mantle boundary temperature (TCMB) on their internal structure and identify regimes with coexisting solid and liquid cores, and deep mantle melting. We find that the range of TCMB for which an inner core is growing increases with the total planet mass and even more with the core mass fraction. Therefore, our results suggest that super-Earths should have a crystallizing core over a large temperature range. We also find that the presence of a growing inner core is likely to be accompanied by a partially liquid lower mantle, which will likely influence planetary thermal evolution. We estimate the initial CMB temperature after super-Earth accretion by assuming an accretional heat retention efficiency similar to Earth. We find that massive super-Earths are expected to have an initial internal temperature consistent with a partially liquid core, allowing for the possibility of thermal and compositional dynamo action.},

Recently described observational trends suggest that rocky exoplanets, that is, planets without significant volatile envelopes, are likely limited to {\textless}1.5 Earth radii. We show that given this likely upper limit in the radii of purely rocky super-Earth exoplanets, the maximum expected core-mantle boundary pressure and adiabatic temperature are relatively moderate, 630 GPa and 5000 K, while the maximum central core pressure varies between 1.5 and 2.5 TPa. We further find that for planets with radii less than 1.5 Earth radii, core-mantle boundary pressure and adiabatic temperature are mostly a function of planet radius and insensitive to planet structure. The pressures and temperatures of rocky exoplanet interiors, then, are less than those explored in recent shock-compression experiments, ab initio calculations, and planetary dynamical studies. We further show that the extrapolation of relevant equations of state does not introduce significant uncertainties in the structural models of these planets. Mass-radius models are more sensitive to bulk composition than any uncertainty in the equation of state, even when extrapolated to terapascal pressures.},

	abstract = {Rocky exoplanets are typically classified as potentially habitable planets, if liquid water exists at the surface. The latter depends on several factors like the abundance of water but also on the amount of available solar energy and greenhouse gases in the atmosphere for a sufficiently long time for life to evolve. The range of distances to the star, where surface water might exist, is called the habitable zone. Here we study the effect of the planet interior of stagnant-lid planets on the formation of a secondary atmosphere through outgassing that would be needed to preserve surface water. We find that volcanic activity and associated outgassing in one-plate planets is strongly reduced after the magma ocean outgassing phase for Earth-like mantle compositions, if their mass and/or core-mass fraction exceeds a critical value. As a consequence, the effective outer boundary of the habitable zone is then closer to the host star than suggested by the classical habitable zone definition, setting an important restriction to the possible surface habitability of massive rocky exoplanets, assuming that they did not keep a substantial amount of their primary atmosphere and that they are not in the plate tectonics regime.},

	abstract = {A key goal of exoplanet spectroscopy is to measure atmospheric properties, such as abundances of chemical species, in order to connect them to our understanding of atmospheric physics and planet formation. In this new era of high-quality JWST data, it is paramount that these measurement methods are robust. When comparing atmospheric models to observations, multiple candidate models may produce reasonable fits to the data. Typically, conclusions are reached by selecting the best-performing model according to some metric. This ignores model uncertainty in favour of specific model assumptions, potentially leading to measured atmospheric properties that are overconfident and/or incorrect. In this paper, we compare three ensemble methods for addressing model uncertainty by combining posterior distributions from multiple analyses: Bayesian model averaging, a variant of Bayesian model averaging using leave-one-out predictive densities, and stacking of predictive distributions. We demonstrate these methods by fitting the HST+Spitzer transmission spectrum of the hot Jupiter HD 209458b using models with different cloud and haze prescriptions. All of our ensemble methods lead to uncertainties on retrieved parameters that are larger, but more realistic, and consistent with physical and chemical expectations. Since they have not typically accounted for model uncertainty, uncertainties of retrieved parameters from HST spectra have likely been underreported. We recommend stacking as the most robust model combination method. Our methods can be used to combine results from independent retrieval codes, and from different models within one code. They are also widely applicable to other exoplanet analysis processes, such as combining results from different data reductions.},

We detect strong features of H\$\_2\$O and CO\$\_2\$ in the JWST transmission spectrum, which when interpreted using a retrieval that assumes thermochemical equilibrium and fractional grey cloud opacity yields \$4{\textasciicircum}\{+5\}\_\{-2\}\$ \${\textbackslash}times\$ solar metallicity and C/O = \$0.08{\textasciicircum}\{+0.09\}\_\{-0.05\}\$. The derived metallicity is consistent with the atmospheric metallicity-planet mass trend observed in solar gas giants. The low C/O ratio suggests that this planet has undergone significant contamination by evaporating planetesimals while migrating inward. We are also able to place upper limits on the abundances of CH\$\_4\$, C\$\_2\$H\$\_2\$ and HCN of log(\${\textbackslash}chi\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{CH\}\_4\}\$) = -4.4, log(\${\textbackslash}chi\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{C\}\_2{\textbackslash}mathrm\{H\}\_2\}\$) = -5.3, and log(\${\textbackslash}chi\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{HCN\}\}\$) = -5.5, which are in tension with the recent claim of a detection of these species using ground-based cross-correlation spectroscopy. We find that HD{\textbackslash},209458b has a weaker CO\$\_2\$ feature size than WASP-39b when comparing their scale-height-normalized transmission spectra. On the other hand, the size of HD{\textbackslash},209458b's H\$\_2\$O feature is stronger, thus reinforcing the low C/O inference.},

	abstract = {The newly operational JWST offers the potential to study the atmospheres of distant worlds with precision that has not been achieved before. One of the first exoplanets observed by JWST in the summer of 2022 was WASP-96 b, a hot Saturn orbiting a G8 star. As a part of the Early Release Observations programme, one transit of WASP-96 b was observed with NIRISS/SOSS to capture its transmission spectrum from 0.6 to 2.85 μm. In this work, we utilize four retrieval frameworks to report precise and robust measurements of WASP-96 b's atmospheric composition. We constrain the logarithmic volume mixing ratios of multiple chemical species in its atmosphere, including: H2O = \$-3.59 {\textasciicircum}\{+ 0.35 \}\_\{- 0.35 \}\$, CO2 = \$-4.38 {\textasciicircum}\{+ 0.47 \}\_\{- 0.57 \}\$, and K = \$-8.04 {\textasciicircum}\{+ 1.22 \}\_\{- 1.71 \}\$, thus generally consistent with 1× solar (with the exception of CO2). Notably, our results offer a first abundance constraint on potassium in WASP-96 b's atmosphere and important inferences on carbon-bearing species such as CO2 and CO. Our short wavelength NIRISS/SOSS data are best explained by the presence of an enhanced Rayleigh scattering slope, despite previous inferences of a clear atmosphere - although we find no evidence for a grey cloud deck. Finally, we explore the data resolution required to appropriately interpret observations using NIRISS/SOSS. We find that our inferences are robust against different binning schemes. That is, from low R = 125 to the native resolution of the instrument, the bulk atmospheric properties of the planet are consistent. Our systematic analysis of these exquisite observations demonstrates the power of NIRISS/SOSS to detect and constrain multiple molecular and atomic species in the atmospheres of hot giant planets.},

	abstract = {Transmission spectroscopy1–3 of exoplanets has revealed signatures of water vapour, aerosols and alkali metals in a few dozen exoplanet atmospheres4,5. However, these previous inferences with the Hubble and Spitzer Space Telescopes were hindered by the observations’ relatively narrow wavelength range and spectral resolving power, which precluded the unambiguous identification of other chemical species—in particular the primary carbon-bearing molecules6,7. Here we report a broad-wavelength 0.5–5.5 µm atmospheric transmission spectrum of WASP-39b8, a 1,200 K, roughly Saturn-mass, Jupiter-radius exoplanet, measured with the JWST NIRSpec’s PRISM mode9 as part of the JWST Transiting Exoplanet Community Early Release Science Team Program10–12. We robustly detect several chemical species at high significance, including Na (19σ), H2O (33σ), CO2 (28σ) and CO (7σ). The non-detection of CH4, combined with a strong CO2 feature, favours atmospheric models with a super-solar atmospheric metallicity. An unanticipated absorption feature at 4 µm is best explained by SO2 (2.7σ), which could be a tracer of atmospheric photochemistry. These observations demonstrate JWST’s sensitivity to a rich diversity of exoplanet compositions and chemical processes.},

One of the targets from the ERO is HAT-P-18b, an inflated Saturn-mass planet with an equilibrium temperature of ∼850 K. We present the NIRISS/SOSS transmission spectrum of HAT-P-18b from 0.6 to 2.8 μm and reveal the planet in the infrared beyond 1.6 μm for the first time. From the spectrum, we see clear water and escaping helium tail features in an otherwise very hazy atmosphere. Our free chemistry retrievals with ATMO show moderate Bayesian evidence (3.79) supporting the presence of methane, but the spectrum does not display any clearly identifiable methane absorption features. The retrieved methane abundance is ∼2 orders of magnitude lower than that of solar composition. The methane-depleted atmosphere strongly rejects simple equilibrium chemistry forward models with solar metallicity and a C/O ratio and disfavors high metallicity (100 times) and a low C/O ratio (0.3). This calls for additional physical processes such as vertical mixing and photochemistry, which can remove methane from the atmosphere.},

We also investigate the stability of the bcc phase of iron beyond Earth's core conditions (3 Mbars) and find that the temperature at which the bcc phase is mechanically stabilized increases with density. Finally, we provide simple fits of these results for convenient use in the modeling of Earthlike exoplanets up to ten Earthmasses, which requires accurate knowledge of the properties of iron up to 15Mbars.},

	abstract = {The future is now - after its long-awaited launch in December 2021, JWST began science operations in July 2022 and is already revolutionizing exoplanet astronomy. The Early Release Observations (ERO) program was designed to provide the first images and spectra from JWST, covering a multitude of science cases and using multiple modes of each on-board instrument. Here, we present transmission spectroscopy observations of the hot-Saturn WASP-96b with the Single Object Slitless Spectroscopy (SOSS) mode of the Near Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph, observed as part of the ERO program. As the SOSS mode presents some unique data reduction challenges, we provide an in-depth walk-through of the major steps necessary for the reduction of SOSS data: including background subtraction, correction of 1/f noise, and treatment of the trace order overlap. We furthermore offer potential routes to correct for field star contamination, which can occur due to the SOSS mode's slitless nature. By comparing our extracted transmission spectrum with grids of atmosphere models, we find an atmosphere metallicity between 1x and 5x solar, and a solar carbon-to-oxygen ratio. Moreover, our models indicate that no grey cloud deck is required to fit WASP-96b's transmission spectrum, but find evidence for a slope shortward of 0.9\${\textbackslash}mu\$m, which could either be caused by enhanced Rayleigh scattering or the red wing of a pressure-broadened Na feature. Our work demonstrates the unique capabilities of the SOSS mode for exoplanet transmission spectroscopy and presents a step-by-step reduction guide for this new and exciting instrument.},

	abstract = {The growing ﬁeld of large-scale time domain astronomy requires methods for probabilistic data analysis that are computationally tractable, even with large data sets. Gaussian processes (GPs) are a popular class of models used for this purpose, but since the computational cost scales, in general, as the cube of the number of data points, their application has been limited to small data sets. In this paper, we present a novel method for GPs modeling in one dimension where the computational requirements scale linearly with the size of the data set. We demonstrate the method by applying it to simulated and real astronomical time series data sets. These demonstrations are examples of probabilistic inference of stellar rotation periods, asteroseismic oscillation spectra, and transiting planet parameters. The method exploits structure in the problem when the covariance function is expressed as a mixture of complex exponentials, without requiring evenly spaced observations or uniform noise. This form of covariance arises naturally when the process is a mixture of stochastically driven damped harmonic oscillators—providing a physical motivation for and interpretation of this choice—but we also demonstrate that it can be a useful effective model in some other cases. We present a mathematical description of the method and compare it to existing scalable GP methods. The method is fast and interpretable, with a range of potential applications within astronomical data analysis and beyond. We provide well-tested and documented open-source implementations of this method in C++, Python, and Julia.},

	abstract = {A number of problems in probability and statistics can be addressed using the multivariate normal (Gaussian) distribution. In the one-dimensional case, computing the probability for a given mean and variance simply requires the evaluation of the corresponding Gaussian density. In the n -dimensional setting, however, it requires the inversion of an n {\textbackslash}times n covariance matrix, C , as well as the evaluation of its determinant, {\textbackslash}det (C) . In many cases, such as regression using Gaussian processes, the covariance matrix is of the form C = {\textbackslash}sigma {\textasciicircum}2 I + K , where K is computed using a specified covariance kernel which depends on the data and additional parameters (hyperparameters). The matrix C is typically dense, causing standard direct methods for inversion and determinant evaluation to require {\textbackslash}mathcal O(n{\textasciicircum}3) work. This cost is prohibitive for large-scale modeling. Here, we show that for the most commonly used covariance functions, the matrix C can be hierarchically factored into a product of block low-rank updates of the identity matrix, yielding an {\textbackslash}mathcal O (n{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}log{\textasciicircum}2{\textbackslash}, n) algorithm for inversion. More importantly, we show that this factorization enables the evaluation of the determinant {\textbackslash}det (C), permitting the direct calculation of probabilities in high dimensions under fairly broad assumptions on the kernel defining K . Our fast algorithm brings many problems in marginalization and the adaptation of hyperparameters within practical reach using a single CPU core. The combination of nearly optimal scaling in terms of problem size with high-performance computing resources will permit the modeling of previously intractable problems. We illustrate the performance of the scheme on standard covariance kernels.},

	abstract = {The Earth’s magnetic field has operated for at least 3.4 billion years, yet how the ancient field was produced is still unknown. The core in the early Earth was surrounded by a molten silicate layer, a basal magma ocean that may have survived for more than one billion years. Here we use density functional theory-based molecular dynamics simulations to predict the electrical conductivity of silicate liquid at the conditions of the basal magma ocean: 100–140 GPa, and 4000–6000 K. We find that the electrical conductivity exceeds 10,000 S/m, more than 100 times that measured in silicate liquids at low pressure and temperature. The magnetic Reynolds number computed from our results exceeds the threshold for dynamo activity and the magnetic field strength is similar to that observed in the Archean paleomagnetic record. We therefore conclude that the Archean field was produced by the basal magma ocean.},

	abstract = {We examine the possible extent of melting in rock-iron super-earths, focusing on those in the habitable zone. We consider the energetics of accretion and core formation, the timescale of cooling and its dependence on viscosity and partial melting, thermal regulation via the temperature dependence of viscosity, and the melting curves of rock and iron components at the ultra-high pressures characteristic of super-earths. We find that the efficiency of kinetic energy deposition during accretion increases with planetary mass; considering the likely role of giant impacts and core formation, we find that super-earths probably complete their accretionary phase in an entirely molten state. Considerations of thermal regulation lead us to propose model temperature profiles of super-earths that are controlled by silicate melting. We estimate melting curves of iron and rock components up to the extreme pressures characteristic of super-earth interiors based on existing experimental and ab initio results and scaling laws. We construct super-earth thermal models by solving the equations of mass conservation and hydrostatic equilibrium, together with equations of state of rock and iron components. We set the potential temperature at the core–mantle boundary and at the surface to the local silicate melting temperature. We find that ancient (∼4 Gyr) super-earths may be partially molten at the top and bottom of their mantles, and that mantle convection is sufficiently vigorous to sustain dynamo action over the whole range of super-earth masses.},

However, these efforts have been hampered by modelling degeneracies between composition and cloud properties that are caused by limited data quality5–9. Here we present the transmission spectrum of WASP-39b obtained using the Single-Object Slitless Spectroscopy (SOSS) mode of the Near Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph (NIRISS) instrument on the JWST. This spectrum spans 0.6–2.8 μm in wavelength and shows several water-absorption bands, the potassium resonance doublet and signatures of clouds. The precision and broad wavelength coverage of NIRISS/SOSS allows us to break model degeneracies between cloud properties and the atmospheric composition of WASP-39b, favouring a heavy-element enhancement (‘metallicity’) of about 10–30 times the solar value, a sub-solar carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) ratio and a solar-to-super-solar potassium-to-oxygen (K/O) ratio. The observations are also best explained by wavelength-dependent, non-grey clouds with inhomogeneous coverageof the planet’s terminator.},

The CO2-CH4 pair in particular is theorized to be a potential biosignature when inferred to be in chemical disequilibrium. Here, we simulate TRAPPIST-1e’s atmosphere using the ExoCAM general circulation model, assuming an optimistic haze-free, tidally locked planet with an aquaplanet surface, with varying atmospheric compositions from 10−4 bar to 1 bar of partial CO2 pressure with 1 bar of background N2. We investigate cases both with and without a modern Earth-like CH4 mixing ratio to examine the effect of CO2 and CH4 on the transmission spectrum and climate state of the planet. We demonstrate that in the optimistic haze-free cloudy case, H2O, CO2, and CH4 could all be detectable in less than 50 transits within an atmosphere of 1 bar N2 and 10 mbar CO2 during JWST’s lifespan with NIRSpec as long as the noise floor is ≲10 ppm. We find that in these optimistic cases, JWST may be able to detect potential biosignature pairs such as CO2-CH4 in TRAPPIST-1e’s atmosphere across a variety of atmospheric CO2 content, and that temporal climate variability does not significantly affect spectral feature variability for NIRSpec PRISM.},

	abstract = {Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a key chemical species that is found in a wide range of planetary atmospheres. In the context of exoplanets, CO2 is an indicator of the metal enrichment (that is, elements heavier than helium, also called ‘metallicity’)1–3, and thus the formation processes of the primary atmospheres of hot gas giants4–6. It is also one of the most promising species to detect in the secondary atmospheres of terrestrial exoplanets7–9. Previous photometric measurements of transiting planets with the Spitzer Space Telescope have given hints of the presence of CO2, but have not yielded definitive detections owing to the lack of unambiguous spectroscopic identification10–12. Here we present the detection of CO2 in the atmosphere of the gas giant exoplanet WASP-39b from transmission spectroscopy observations obtained with JWST as part of the Early Release Science programme13,14. The data used in this study span 3.0–5.5 micrometres in wavelength and show a prominent CO2 absorption feature at 4.3 micrometres (26-sigma significance). The overall spectrum is well matched by one-dimensional, ten-times solar metallicity models that assume radiative–convective–thermochemical equilibrium and have moderate cloud opacity. These models predict that the atmosphere should have water, carbon monoxide and hydrogen sulfide in addition to CO2, but little methane. Furthermore, we also tentatively detect a small absorption feature near 4.0 micrometres that is not reproduced by these models.},

In this study, we present a comprehensive analysis of this dataset utilizing a forward modelling approach. We explore five distinct atmospheric models, each aiming to encompass diverse physical and chemical phenomena proposed to happen in cool atmospheres in a self-consistent way. Our aim is to assess their performance in estimating key atmospheric parameters: Teff, log(g), [M/H], C/O, gamma, fsed, and R. To achieve this, we apply our Bayesian framework, ForMoSA, employing an optimized nested sampling algorithm for model-data comparison. Our findings reveal that each parameter's estimate is significantly influenced by factors such as the wavelength range considered, the spectral features used, the signal-to-noise ratio, and the model chosen for the fit. The observed parameter dispersion may be attributed to systematic error in the models, resulting from their difficulties in accurately replicating the complex atmospheric structure of VHS1256b, notably the complexity of its clouds and dust distribution. To propagate the impact of these systematic uncertainties on our atmospheric property estimates, we introduce innovative fitting methodologies based on independent fits performed on different spectral windows. We finally derived a Teff consistent with the spectral type of the target, considering its young age, which is confirmed by our estimate of log(g). Despite the exceptional data quality, attaining robust estimates for chemical abundances [M/H] and C/O, often employed as indicators of formation history, remains challenging with estimates dispersed on the entire range explored by the model grids.},

	abstract = {When observing the atmospheres of transiting exoplanets using high-resolution spectroscopy, one aims to detect well-resolved spectral features with high signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) as is possible today with modern spectrographs. However, obtaining such high-quality observations comes with a trade-off: a lower cadence of fewer, longer exposures across the transit collects more photons thanks to reduced overheads, enhancing the SNR of each observation, while a higher cadence of several, shorter exposures minimises spectral feature smearing due to the continuously changing radial velocity of the planet. Considering that maximising SNR and minimising smearing are both beneficial to analysis, there is a need to establish where the optimal compromise lies. In this work, we model real transit events based on targets as they would be observed with VLT/CRIRES+ at Paranal Observatory. Creating four hypothetical scenarios, we simulate each observation across 100 realisations of the same transit event in order to vary the time resolution only. We remove telluric and stellar lines using the SYSREM algorithm and analyse them through cross-correlation with model templates, measuring how successfully each time resolution and case detects the planetary signal. We demonstrate that there is a continuous change in the detection significance based on time resolutions, and that the function of this significance has clear maxima. The strength and location of this maxima varies on e.g. planet system parameters, instrumentation, and no. of removal iterations. We discuss why observers should therefore take several factors into account, using a strategy akin to the 'exposure triangle' from traditional photography where a balance must be struck by considering the full context of the observation. Our method is robust and may be employed by observers to estimate best observational strategies for other targets.},

	abstract = {Transiting exoplanets provide detailed access to their atmospheres, as the planet's signal can be effectively separated from that of its host star. For transiting exoplanets three fundamental atmospheric measurements are possible: transmission spectra - where atmospheric absorption features are detected across an exoplanets limb during transit, emission spectra - where the day-side average emission of the planet is detected during secondary eclipse events, and phase curves - where the spectral emission of the planet is mapped globally following the planet around its orbit. All of these techniques have been well proven to provide detailed characterisation information about planets ranging from super-Earth to Jupiter size. In this chapter, I present the overall background, history and methodology of these measurements. A few of the major science related questions are also discussed, which range from broad questions about planet formation and migration, to detailed atmospheric physics questions about how a planet's atmosphere responds under extreme conditions. I also discuss the analysis methods and light-curve fitting techniques that have been developed to help reach the extreme spectrophotometric accuracies needed, and how to derive reliable error estimates despite limiting systematic errors. As a transmission spectra derived from primary transit is a unique measurement outside of our solar system, I discuss its physical interpretation and the underlying degeneracies associated with the measurement.},

GJ 367b is a hot (T\_eq=1370 K), extremely dense (10.2 +- 1.3 g/cm{\textasciicircum}3) sub-Earth orbiting a M dwarf on a 0.32 d orbit. We measure an eclipse depth of 79 +- 4 ppm, a nightside planet-to-star flux ratio of 4 +- 8 ppm, and a relative phase amplitude of 0.97 +- 0.10-- all fully consistent with a zero-albedo planet with no heat recirculation. Su ch a scenario is also consistent with the phase offset of 11 +- 5 degrees East to within 2.2\${\textbackslash}sigma\$. The emission spectrum is likewise consistent with a blackbody with no heat redistribution and a low albedo of A\_B {\textasciitilde} 0.1, with the exception of one anomalous wavelength bin that we attribute to unexplained systematics. The emission spectrum puts few constraints on the surface composition, but rules out a CO2 atmosphere {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde} 1 bar, an outgassed atmosphere {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}10 mbar (under heavily reducing conditions), or an outgassed atmosphere {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}0.01 mbar (under heavily oxidizing conditions). The lack of day-night heat recirculation implies that 1 bar atmospheres are ruled out for a wide range of compositions, while 0.1 bar atmospheres are consistent with the data. Taken together with the fact that most of the dayside should be molten, our JWST observations suggest the planet must have lost the vast majority of its initial inventory of volatiles.},

We use three independent pipelines to reduce the data from the three JWST visits and perform several tests to check for the significance of an atmosphere. Overall, our analysis does not uncover evidence of an atmosphere. Our null hypothesis tests find that none of our pipelines' transmission spectra can rule out a flat line, although there is weak evidence for a Gaussian feature in two spectra from different pipelines (at 2.3 and \$2.9{\textbackslash}sigma\$). However, the candidate features are seen at different wavelengths (4.3 \${\textbackslash}mu\$m vs 4.7 \${\textbackslash}mu\$m), and our retrieval analysis finds that different gas species can explain these features in the two reductions (CO\$\_2\$ at \$3.1{\textbackslash}sigma\$ compared to O\$\_3\$ at \$2.9{\textbackslash}sigma\$), suggesting that they are not real astrophysical signals. Our forward model analysis rules out a low mean molecular weight atmosphere (\${\textless} 350{\textbackslash}times\$ solar metallicity) to at least \$3{\textbackslash}sigma\$, and disfavors CH\$\_4\$-dominated atmospheres at \$1-3{\textbackslash}sigma\$, depending on the reduction. Instead, the forward models find our transmission spectra are consistent with no atmosphere, a hazy atmosphere, or an atmosphere containing a species that does not have prominent molecular bands across the NIRCam/F444W bandpass, such as a water-dominated atmosphere. Our results demonstrate the unequivocal need for two or more transit observations analyzed with multiple reduction pipelines, alongside rigorous statistical tests, to determine the robustness of molecular detections for small exoplanet atmospheres.},

The high pressures and temperatures in their interiors are likely to lead to long-lived magma oceans. If their electrical conductivity is sufficiently high, the mantles of Super-Earth would generate their own magnetic fields. With ab initio simulations, we show that upon melting, the behavior of typical mantle silicates changes from semi-conducting to semi-metallic. The electrical conductivity increases and the optical properties are substantially modified. Melting could thus be detected with high-precision reflectivity measurements during the short time scales of shock experiments. We estimate the electrical conductivity of mantle silicates to be of the order of 100 Ω−1 cm−1, which implies that a magnetic dynamo process would develop in the magma oceans of Super-Earths if their convective velocities have typical values of 1 mm/s or higher. We predict exoplanets with rotation periods longer than 2 days to have multipolar magnetic fields.},

	abstract = {Hot Jupiters exhibit large day-night temperature contrasts. Their cooler nightsides are thought to host clouds. However, the exact nature of these clouds, their spatial distribution, and their impact on atmospheric dynamics, thermal structure, and spectra is still unclear. We investigate the atmosphere of WASP-43 b, a short period hot Jupiter recently observed with JWST, to understand the radiative and dynamical impact of clouds on the atmospheric circulation and thermal structure. We aim to understand the impact of different kinds of condensates potentially forming in WASP-43 b, with various sizes and atmospheric metallicities. We used a 3D global climate model (GCM) with a new temperature-dependent cloud model that includes radiative feed-backs coupled with hydrodynamical integrations to study the atmospheric properties of WASP-43 b. We produced observables from our simulations and compared them to spectral phase curves from various observations. We show that clouds have a net warming effect, meaning that the greenhouse effect caused by clouds is stronger than the albedo cooling effect. We show that the radiative effect of clouds has various impacts on the dynamical and thermal structure of WASP-43 b. Depending on the type of condensates and their sizes, the radiative-dynamical feedback will modify the horizontal and vertical temperature gradient and reduce the wind speed. For super-solar metallicity atmospheres, fewer clouds form in the atmosphere, leading to a weaker feedback. Comparisons with spectral phase curves observed with HST, Spitzer, and JWST indicate that WASP-43 b s nightside is cloudy and rule out sub-micron Mg2SiO4 cloud particles as the main opacity source. Distinguishing between cloudy solar and cloudy super-solar-metallicity atmospheres is not straightforward, and further observations of both reflected light and thermal emission are needed.},

              Over the last decade exoplanetary transmission spectra have yielded an unprecedented understanding about the physical and chemical nature of planets outside our solar system. Physical and chemical knowledge is mainly extracted via fitting competing models to spectroscopic data, based on some goodness-of-fit metric. However, current employed metrics shed little light on how exactly a given model is failing at the individual data point level and where it could be improved. As the quality of our data and complexity of our models increases, there is a need to better understand which observations are driving our model interpretations. Here we present the application of Bayesian leave-one-out cross-validation to assess the performance of exoplanet atmospheric models and compute the expected log pointwise predictive density (elpd

              to interpret current observations of HAT-P-41 b and assess the reliability of recent inferences of H

This is the ﬁrst reﬂected light photometric eclipse using UVIS in scanning mode; as such, we further detail our scanning extraction and analysis pipeline Arctor. Our HST WFC3/UVIS eclipse light curve for WASP-43b derived a 3σ upper limit of 67 ppm on the eclipse depth, which implies that WASP-43b has a very dark dayside atmosphere. With our atmospheric modeling campaign, we compared our reﬂected light constraints with predictions from global circulation and cloud models benchmarked with HST and Spitzer observations of WASP43b. We infer that we do not detect clouds on the dayside within the pressure levels probed by HST WFC3/UVIS with the F350LP ﬁlter (P {\textgreater} 1 bar). This is consistent with the general circulation model predictions based on previous WASP-43b observations. Dayside emission spectroscopy results from WASP-43b with HST and Spitzer observations are likely to not be signiﬁcantly affected by contributions from cloud particles.},

	abstract = {This chapter reviews theoretical approaches to calculating the energy and entropy budgets of the Earth’s core. The energy budget allows the growth of the inner core with time to be calculated; the entropy budget determines whether or not a geodynamo can function. The present-day geodynamo is driven primarily by compositional convection, with latent heat and secular cooling playing a subsidiary role. Prior to the onset of inner-core solidification, the dynamo was driven purely by secular cooling and required a cooling rate roughly 3 times the present-day rate to maintain the same dissipation. The largest uncertainties in the present-day energy and entropy budgets arise from uncertainties in the core–mantle boundary (CMB) heat flow, the compositional density contrast between the outer and inner core, the melting behavior of the core material, the thermal conductivity of the core, and the amount of Ohmic dissipation generated by the dynamo. The present-day CMB heat flow is estimated at 6–14×1012 W (6–14 TW), sufficient to sustain a dynamo dissipating a few terawatts of heat. Based on four independent studies, this CMB heat flow implies an inner-core age range of 0.37–1.90Gy, significantly less than both the age of the Earth and measurements of Re–Os isotopes, which may imply an inner-core age of ∼3.5Gy. Adding potassium to the core results in lower initial core temperatures, and also allows inner-core ages compatible with the geochemical estimates, but only if the CMB heat flow has remained low (e.g., {\textless}9 TW for 300ppm potassium) for the whole of Earth history. Whether such a relatively constant heat flow is a likely outcome of the mantle’s thermal evolution remains to be seen.},

Often however, simple and even unphysical models are adopted to represent the X-ray spectra of AGN, which do not capture the complexity and diversity of the observations. In the case of blank field surveys in particular, this should have an impact on e.g. the determination of the AGN luminosity function, the inferred accretion history of the Universe and also on our understanding of the relation between AGN and their host galaxies. {\textless}i{\textgreater}Methods. {\textless}i/{\textgreater}We develop a Bayesian framework for model comparison and parameter estimation of X-ray spectra. We take into account uncertainties associated with both the Poisson nature of X-ray data and the determination of source redshift using photometric methods. We also demonstrate how Bayesian model comparison can be used to select among ten different physically motivated X-ray spectral models the one that provides a better representation of the observations. This methodology is applied to X-ray AGN in the 4 Ms {\textless}i{\textgreater}Chandra {\textless}i/{\textgreater}Deep Field South.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Results. {\textless}i/{\textgreater}For the {\textasciitilde}350 AGN in that field, our analysis identifies four components needed to represent the diversity of the observed X-ray spectra: (1) an intrinsic power law; (2) a cold obscurer which reprocesses the radiation due to photo-electric absorption, Compton scattering and Fe-K fluorescence; (3) an unabsorbed power law associated with Thomson scattering off ionised clouds; and (4) Compton reflection, most noticeable from a stronger-than-expected Fe-K line. Simpler models, such as a photo-electrically absorbed power law with a Thomson scattering component, are ruled out with decisive evidence ({\textless}i{\textgreater}B{\textless}i/{\textgreater} {\textgreater} 100). We also find that ignoring the Thomson scattering component results in underestimation of the inferred column density, {\textless}i{\textgreater}N{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}H{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}, of the obscurer. Regarding the geometry of the obscurer, there is strong evidence against both a completely closed (e.g. sphere), or entirely open (e.g. blob of material along the line of sight), toroidal geometry in favour of an intermediate case. {\textless}i{\textgreater}Conclusions. {\textless}i/{\textgreater}Despite the use of low-count spectra, our methodology is able to draw strong inferences on the geometry of the torus. Simpler models are ruled out in favour of a geometrically extended structure with significant Compton scattering. We confirm the presence of a soft component, possibly associated with Thomson scattering off ionised clouds in the opening angle of the torus. The additional Compton reflection required by data over that predicted by toroidal geometry models, may be a sign of a density gradient in the torus or reflection off the accretion disk. Finally, we release a catalogue of AGN in the CDFS with estimated parameters such as the accretion luminosity in the 2−10 keV band and the column density, {\textless}i{\textgreater}N{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}H{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}, of the obscurer.},

	abstract = {Exoplanets—planets orbiting around stars other than our own Sun—appear to be common. Significant research effort is now focused on the observation and characterization of exoplanet atmospheres. Species such as water vapour, methane, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide have been observed in a handful of hot, giant, gaseous planets, but cooler, smaller planets such as Gliese 1214b are now analysable with current telescopes. Water is the key chemical dictating habitability. The current observations of water in exoplanets from both space and the ground are reviewed. Controversies surrounding the interpretation of these observations are discussed. Detailed consideration of available radiative transfer models and linelists are used to analyse these differences in interpretation. Models suggest that there is a clear need for data on the pressure broadening of water transitions by H2 at high temperatures. The reported detections of water appear to be robust, although final confirmation will have to await the better quality observational data provided by currently planned dedicated space missions.},

The species addressed include the alkali metals, iron, heavy metal oxides, metal hydrides, H2, H2O, CH4, CO, NH3, H2S, PH3, and representative grains. Once monochromatic absorption cross sections for all constituents have been derived, chemical abundances have to be obtained before the resulting product can be summed to obtain total opacities.

We also present tables of Rosseland and Planck mean opacities, which are of use in some studies of the atmospheres, interiors, and evolution of planets and brown dwarfs. For the tables presented here we have included the opacities of important atomic and molecular species, including the alkali elements, pressure-induced absorption by hydrogen, and other significant opacity sources, but we neglect opacity from condensates. We report for each species how we have assembled molecular line data from a combination of public databases, laboratory data that is not yet in the public databases, and our own numerical calculations. We combine these opacities with abundances computed from a chemical equilibrium model using recently revised solar abundances to compute mean opacities. The chemical equilibrium calculation accounts for the settling of condensates in a gravitational field and is applicable to ultracool dwarf and extrasolar planetary atmospheres, but not circumstellar disks. We find that the inclusion of alkali atomic opacity substantially increases the mean opacities over those currently in the literature at densities relevant to the atmospheres and interiors of giant planets and brown dwarfs. We provide our opacity tables for public use and discuss their limitations.},

We perform a detailed parameter space study using three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations to understand the effect of changing stellar wind magnetic ﬁeld and planetary magnetic ﬁeld strengths on planetary magnetospheric topology and atmospheric losses. It is observed that the relative strengths of stellar and planetary magnetic ﬁelds play a signiﬁcant role in determining the steady-state magnetospheric conﬁguration and atmospheric erosion. When the stellar ﬁeld is strengthened or the planetary ﬁeld is weakened, stellar magnetic ﬁeld accumulation occurs at the dayside of the planet, forcing the magnetopause to shift closer to its surface.

We establish an analytic equation relating the atmospheric mass-loss rates to stellar and planetary magnetic ﬁeld strengths, which successfully explains the modeled behavior.

	abstract = {The atmospheres of highly irradiated exoplanets are observed to undergo hydrodynamic escape. However, due to strong pressures, stellar winds can confine planetary atmospheres, reducing their escape. Here, we investigate under which conditions atmospheric escape of close-in giants could be confined by the large pressure of their host star’s winds. For that, we simulate escape in planets at a range of orbital distances ([0.04, 0.14] au), planetary gravities ([36, 87 per cent] of Jupiter’s gravity), and ages ([1, 6.9] Gyr). For each of these simulations, we calculate the ram pressure of these escaping atmospheres and compare them to the expected stellar wind external pressure to determine whether a given atmosphere is confined or not. We show that although younger close-in giants should experience higher levels of atmospheric escape, due to higher stellar irradiation, stellar winds are also stronger at young ages, potentially reducing escape of young exoplanets. Regardless of the age, we also find that there is always a region in our parameter space where atmospheric escape is confined, preferably occurring at higher planetary gravities and orbital distances. We investigate confinement of some known exoplanets and find that the atmosphere of several of them, including π Men c, should be confined by the winds of their host stars, thus potentially preventing escape in highly irradiated planets. Thus, the lack of hydrogen escape recently reported for π Men c could be caused by the stellar wind.},

	abstract = {Stellar wind and photon radiation interactions with a planet can cause atmospheric depletion, which may have a potentially catastrophic impact on a planet’s habitability. While photon interactions with planetary atmospheres and outflows have been researched to some degree, studies of stellar wind interactions are in their infancy. Here, we use three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations to model the effect of the stellar wind on the magnetosphere and outflow of a hypothetical planet, modeled to have an H-rich evaporating envelope with a prescribed mass-loss rate, orbiting in the habitable zone close to a low-mass M dwarf. We take the TRAPPIST-1 system as a prototype, with our simulated planet situated at the orbit of TRAPPIST-1e. We show that the atmospheric outflow is accelerated and advected upon interaction with the wind, resulting in a diverse range of planetary magnetosphere morphologies and plasma distributions as local stellar wind conditions change along the orbit. We consider the implications of the wind–outflow interaction on potential hydrogen Lyα observations of the planetary atmosphere during transits. The Lyα observational signatures depend strongly on the local wind conditions at the time of the observation and can be subject to considerable variation on timescales as short as an hour. Our results indicate that observed variations in exoplanet transit signatures could be explained by wind–outflow interaction.},

In this equation, all the terms can be expressed theoretically and, given values and uncertainties of all relevant physical parameters, the age of the inner core can be obtained as a function of the heat flux at the core–mantle boundary and the concentrations in radioactive elements. It is found that in absence of radioactive elements in the core, the age of the inner core cannot exceed 2.5 Ga and is most likely around 1 Ga. In addition, to have an inner core as old as the Earth, concentrations in radioactive elements needed in the core are too high to be acceptable on geochemical grounds.},

	abstract = {The “new core paradox” suggests that the persistence of the geomagnetic field over nearly all of Earth history is in conflict with the core being highly thermally conductive, which makes convection and dynamo action in the core much harder prior to the nucleation of the inner core. Here we revisit this issue by exploring the influence of six important parameters on core evolution: upper/lower mantle viscosity ratio, core thermal conductivity, core radiogenic heat rate, mantle radiogenic heating rate, central core melting temperature, and initial core-mantle boundary (CMB) temperature. Each parameter is systematically explored by the model, which couples mantle energy and core energy-entropy evolution. A model is “successful” if the correct present-day inner core size is achieved and the dynamo remains alive, as implied by the paleomagnetic record. In agreement with previous studies, we do not find successful thermal evolutions using nominal parameters, which includes a core thermal conductivity of 70 Wm−1K−1, zero core radioactivity, and an initial CMB temperature of 5,000 K. The dynamo can be kept alive by assuming an unrealistically low thermal conductivity of 20 Wm−1K−1 or an unrealistically high core radioactive heat flow of 3 TW at present-day, which are considered “unsuccessful” models. We identify a third scenario to keep the dynamo alive by assuming a hot initial CMB temperature of ∼6,000 K and a central core liquidus of ∼5,550 K. These temperatures are on the extreme end of typical estimates, but should not be ruled out and deserve further scrutiny.},

	abstract = {The use of Gaussian processes (GPs) is a common approach to account for correlated noise in exoplanet time-series, particularly for transmission and emission spectroscopy. This analysis has typically been performed for each wavelength channel separately, with the retrieved uncertainties in the transmission spectrum assumed to be independent. However, the presence of noise correlated in wavelength could cause these uncertainties to be correlated, which could significantly affect the results of atmospheric retrievals. We present a method which uses a GP to model noise correlated in both wavelength and time simultaneously for the full spectroscopic data set while avoiding the use of a 'common-mode' correction. To make this analysis computationally tractable, we introduce a fast and flexible GP method which can analyse 2D data sets when the input points lie on a (potentially non-uniform) 2D grid - in our case a time by wavelength grid - and the kernel function has a Kronecker product structure. This simultaneously fits all light curves and enables the retrieval of the covariance matrix of the transmission spectrum. By testing on synthetic data sets, we demonstrate that our new approach can reliably recover atmospheric features contaminated by noise correlated in time and wavelength. In contrast, fitting each spectroscopic light curve separately performed poorly when wavelength-correlated noise was present. It frequently underestimated the uncertainty of the scattering slope and overestimated the uncertainty in the strength of sharp absorption peaks in transmission spectra. Two archival VLT/FORS2 transit observations of WASP-31b were re-analysed, with our method strongly constraining the presence of wavelength-correlated noise in both data sets and recovering significantly different constraints on atmospheric features such as the scattering slope and strength of sodium and potassium features.},

	abstract = {The JWST is ushering in a new era in remote sensing of exoplanetary atmospheres. Atmospheric retrievals of exoplanets can be highly sensitive to high-precision JWST data. It is, therefore, imperative to characterize the instruments and noise sources using early observations to enable robust characterization of exoplanetary atmospheres using JWST-quality spectra. This work is a step in that direction, focusing on the Near Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph (NIRISS) Single Object Slitless Spectroscopy (SOSS) instrument mode, with a wavelength coverage of 0.6–2.8 \${\textbackslash}mu\$m and R ∼ 700. Using a custom-built pipeline, JExoRES, we investigate key diagnostics of NIRISS SOSS with observations of two giant exoplanets, WASP-39 b and WASP-96 b, as case studies. We conduct a detailed evaluation of the different aspects of the data reduction and analysis, including sources of contamination, 1/f noise, and system properties such as limb darkening. The slitless nature of NIRISS SOSS makes it susceptible to contamination due to background sources. We present a method to model and correct for dispersed field stars that can significantly improve the accuracy of the observed spectra. In doing so, we also report an empirically determined throughput function for the instrument. We find significant correlated noise in the derived spectra, which may be attributed to 1/f noise, and discuss its implications for spectral binning. We quantify the covariance matrix that would enable the consideration of correlated noise in atmospheric retrievals. Finally, we conduct a comparative assessment of NIRISS SOSS spectra of WASP-39 b reported using different pipelines and highlight important lessons for exoplanet spectroscopy with JWST NIRISS.},

Prior observations with {\textless}i{\textgreater}Hubble{\textless}i/{\textgreater}/WFC3, {\textless}i{\textgreater}Spitzer{\textless}i/{\textgreater}/IRAC, and VLT/FORS2 have been combined into a single spectrum for which retrievals suggest a cold but cloud-free atmosphere.

The ARCiS retrieval framework was applied to the pre-JWST WASP-96b transit spectrum to investigate the apparent contradiction between cloudy models and assumed cloud-free transit spectrum.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Results.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} Clouds are predicted to be ubiquitous throughout the atmosphere of WASP-96b. Silicate materials contribute between 40\% and 90\% cloud particle volume, which means that metal oxides also contribute with up to 40\% cloud particle volume in the low-pressure regimes that affect spectra. We explore how these cloudy models match currently available transit spectra. Reduced vertical mixing acts to settle clouds to deeper in the atmosphere, and an increased cloud particle porosity reduces the opacity of clouds in the near-IR and optical region. These two effects allow for clearer molecular features to be observed while still allowing clouds to be in the atmosphere.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Conclusions.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} The atmosphere of WASP-96b is unlikely to be cloud free. Retrievals of HST, {\textless}i{\textgreater}Spitzer{\textless}i/{\textgreater}, and VLT spectra also show that multiple cloudy solutions reproduce the data. JWST observations will be affected by clouds, where the cloud top pressure varies by an order of magnitude within even the NIRISS wavelength range. The long-wavelength end of NIRSpec and the short-wavelength end of MIRI may probe atmospheric asymmetries between the limbs of the terminator on WASP-96b.},

	abstract = {The study of exoplanetary atmospheres relies on detecting minute changes in the transit depth at different wavelengths. To date, a number of ground- and space-based instruments have been used to obtain transmission spectra of exoplanets in different spectral bands. One common practice is to combine observations from different instruments in order to achieve a broader wavelength coverage. We present here two inconsistent observations of WASP-96 b, one by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and the other by the Very Large Telescope (VLT). We present two key findings in our investigation: (1) a strong water signature is detected via the HST WFC3 observations and (2) a notable offset in transit depth ({\textgreater}1100 ppm) can be seen when the ground-based and space-based observations are combined. The discrepancy raises the question of whether observations from different instruments could indeed be combined. We attempt to align the observations by including an additional parameter in our retrieval studies but are unable to definitively ascertain that the aligned observations are indeed compatible. The case of WASP-96 b signals that compatibility of instruments should not be assumed. While wavelength overlaps between instruments can help, it should be noted that combining data sets remains risky business. The difficulty of combining observations also strengthens the need for next-generation instruments that possess broader spectral coverage.},

	abstract = {We present new analysis of infrared transmission spectroscopy of the cloud-free hot-Saturn WASP-96b performed with the Hubble and Spitzer Space Telescopes (HST and Spitzer). The WASP-96b spectrum exhibits the absorption feature from water in excellent agreement with synthetic spectra computed assuming a cloud-free atmosphere. The HST-Spitzer spectrum is coupled with Very Large Telescope (VLT) optical transmission spectroscopy which reveals the full pressure-broadened profile of the sodium absorption feature and enables the derivation of absolute abundances. We confirm and correct for a spectral offset of \${\textbackslash}Delta R\_\{\{{\textbackslash}rm p\}\}/R\_\{{\textbackslash}ast \}=(-4.29{\textasciicircum}\{+0.31\}\_\{-0.37\}){\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\$ of the VLT data relative to the HST-Spitzer spectrum. This offset can be explained by the assumed radius for the common-mode correction of the VLT spectra, which is a well-known feature of ground-based transmission spectroscopy. We find evidence for a lack of chromospheric and photometric activity of the host star which therefore make a negligible contribution to the offset. We measure abundances for Na and O that are consistent with solar to supersolar, with abundances relative to solar values of \$21{\textasciicircum}\{+27\}\_\{-14\}\$ and \$7{\textasciicircum}\{+11\}\_\{-4\}\$, respectively. We complement the transmission spectrum with new thermal emission constraints from Spitzer observations at 3.6 and 4.5 \${\textbackslash}mu\$m, which are best explained by the spectrum of an atmosphere with a temperature decreasing with altitude. A fit to the spectrum assuming an isothermal blackbody atmosphere constrains the dayside temperature to be Tp = 1545 ± 90 K.},

Since these missions will be sensitive to stellar oscillations and granulation even for dwarf stars, they will be limited by stellar variability. Therefore, it is crucial and timely to develop robust methods to account for and correct for stellar variability.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Aims.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} We tested the performance of Gaussian process (GP) regression on the characterisation of transiting planets, and in particular to determine how many components of variability are necessary to describe high cadence, high signal-to-noise light curves expected from CHEOPS and PLATO. To achieve this, we selected a sample of bright stars observed in the asteroseismology field of CoRoT at high cadence (32 s) and high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N).{\textless}i{\textgreater}Methods.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} We used GPs to model stellar variability including different combinations of stellar oscillations, granulation, and rotational modulation models. We preformed model comparison to find the best activity model fit to our data. We compared the best multi-component model with the usual one-component model used for transit retrieval and with a non-GP model.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Results.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} We found that the best GP stellar variability model contains four to five variability components: one stellar oscillation component, two to four granulation components, and/or one rotational modulation component, which is consistent with results from asteroseismology. However, this high number of components is in contrast with the one-component GP model (1GP) commonly used in the literature for transit characterisation. Therefore, we compared the performance of the best multi-component GP model with the 1GP model in the derivation of transit parameters of simulated transits. We found that for Jupiter- and Neptune-size planets the best multi-component GP model is slightly better than the 1GP model, and much better than the non-GP model that gives biased results. For Earth-size planets, the 1GP model fails to retrieve the transit because it is a poor description of stellar activity. The non-GP model gives some biased results and the best multi-component GP is capable of retrieving the correct transit model parameters.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Conclusions.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} We conclude that when characterising transiting exoplanets with high S/Ns and high cadence light curves, we need models that couple the description of stellar variability with the transits analysis, like GPs. Moreover, for Earth-like exoplanets a better description of stellar variability (achieved using multi-component models) improves the planetary characterisation. Our results are particularly important for the analysis of TESS, CHEOPS, and PLATO light curves.},

	abstract = {Observations of exoplanet atmospheres in high resolution have the potential to resolve individual planetary absorption lines, despite the issues associated with ground-based observations. The removal of contaminating stellar and telluric absorption features is one of the most sensitive steps required to reveal the planetary spectrum and, while many different detrending methods exist, it remains difficult to directly compare the performance and efficacy of these methods. Additionally, though the standard cross-correlation method enables robust detection of specific atmospheric species, it only probes for features that are expected a priori. Here, we present a novel methodology using Gaussian process (GP) regression to directly model the components of high-resolution spectra, which partially addresses these issues. We use two archival CRyogenic Infra-Red Echelle Spectrograph (CRIRES)/Very Large Telescope (VLT) data sets as test cases, observations of the hot Jupiters HD 189733 b and 51 Pegasi b, recovering injected signals with average line contrast ratios of ∼4.37 × 10−3 and ∼1.39 × 10−3, and planet radial velocities ΔKp = 1.45 ± 1.53 \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{km{\textbackslash}, s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\}\$ and ΔKp = 0.12 ± 0.12 \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{km{\textbackslash}, s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\}\$ from the injection velocities, respectively. In addition, we demonstrate an application of the GP method to assess the impact of the detrending process on the planetary spectrum, by implementing injection-recovery tests. We show that standard detrending methods used in the literature negatively affect the amplitudes of absorption features in particular, which has the potential to render retrieval analyses inaccurate. Finally, we discuss possible limiting factors for the non-detections using this method, likely to be remedied by higher signal-to-noise data.},

	abstract = {The hot-Neptune desert is one of the most sparsely populated regions of the exoplanet parameter space, and atmosphere observations of its few residents can provide insights into how such planets have managed to survive in such an inhospitable environment. Here, we present transmission observations of LTT 9779 b, the only known hot-Neptune to have retained a significant H/He-dominated atmosphere, taken with JWST NIRISS/SOSS. The 0.6-2.85\${\textbackslash}mu\$m transmission spectrum shows evidence for muted spectral features, rejecting a perfectly flat line at {\textgreater}5\${\textbackslash}sigma\$. We explore water and methane-dominated atmosphere scenarios for LTT 9779 b's terminator, and retrieval analyses reveal a continuum of potential combinations of metallicity and cloudiness. Through comparisons to previous population synthesis works and our own interior structure modelling, we are able to constrain LTT 9779 b's atmosphere metallicity to 20-850x solar. Within this range of metallicity, our retrieval analyses prefer solutions with clouds at mbar pressures, regardless of whether the atmosphere is water- or methane-dominated -- though cloud-free atmospheres with metallicities {\textgreater}500x solar cannot be entirely ruled out. By comparing self-consistent atmosphere temperature profiles with cloud condensation curves, we find that silicate clouds can readily condense in the terminator region of LTT 9779 b. Advection of these clouds onto the day-side could explain the high day-side albedo previously inferred for this planet and be part of a feedback loop aiding the survival of LTT 9779 b's atmosphere in the hot-Neptune desert.},

	abstract = {Transmission spectroscopy, which consists of measuring the wavelength-dependent absorption of starlight by a planet’s atmosphere during a transit, is a powerful probe of atmospheric composition. However, the expected signal is typically orders of magnitude smaller than instrumental systematics and the results are crucially dependent on the treatment of the latter. In this paper, we propose a new method to infer transit parameters in the presence of systematic noise using Gaussian processes, a technique widely used in the machine learning community for Bayesian regression and classification problems. Our method makes use of auxiliary information about the state of the instrument, but does so in a non-parametric manner, without imposing a specific dependence of the systematics on the instrumental parameters, and naturally allows for the correlated nature of the noise. We give an example application of the method to archival NICMOS transmission spectroscopy of the hot Jupiter HD 189733, which goes some way towards reconciling the controversy surrounding this data set in the literature. Finally, we provide an appendix giving a general introduction to Gaussian processes for regression, in order to encourage their application to a wider range of problems.},

In the coolest and densest atmospheres, such as those of T dwarfs, Na I and K I broadened by molecular hydrogen and helium can come to dominate the entire optical spectrum. The effects of Na-He collision broadening are also central to understanding the opacity of cool DZ white dwarf stars. Aims: In order to be able to construct synthetic spectra of brown dwarfs and cool DZ white dwarfs, where helium density can reach several 1021 cm−3, Na-He line profiles of the resonance lines have been computed over a wide range of densities and temperatures. Methods: Unified line profiles that are valid from the core to the far wings at high densities are calculated in the semiclassical approach using up-to-date molecular data including electronic spin-orbit coupling from the sodium atom. Far wings are extended to more than 4000 cm−1 from the line center when the helium density can reach 1021 cm−3 at 5000 K. Results: We present a comprehensive study of Na-He collisional profiles at high density, and temperatures from 5000 K, which is the temperature prevailing in the atmosphere of ultra-cool DZ white dwarf stars, down to 1 K, which is the temperature in liquid helium clusters. Collision broadening and shift parameters within the impact approximation obtained in the semiclassical and quantum theory using our new accurate molecular data are presented.

	abstract = {Observations of cooler and cooler brown dwarfs show that the contribution from broadening at many bars pressure is becoming important. The opacity in the red optical to near-IR region under these conditions is dominated by the extremely pressure-broadened wings of the alkali resonance lines, in particular, the K I resonance doublet at 0.77 μm. Collisions with H2 are preponderant in brown dwarf atmospheres at an effective temperature of about 1000 K; the H2 perturber densities reach several 1019 even in Jupiter-mass planets and exceed 1020 for super-Jupiters and older Y dwarfs. As a consequence, it appears that when the far wing absorption due to alkali atoms in a dense H2 atmosphere is significant, accurate pressure broadened profiles that are valid at high densities of H2 should be incorporated into spectral models.

	abstract = {Seismic observations indicate that the lowermost mantle above the core–mantle boundary (CMB) is strongly heterogeneous. Body waves reveal a variety of ultra-low velocity zones (ULVZs), which extend not more than 100 km above the CMB and have shear velocity reductions of up to 30 per cent. While the nature and origin of these ULVZs remain uncertain, some have suggested they are evidence of partial melting at the base of mantle plumes. Here we use coupled geodynamic/thermodynamic modelling to explore the hypothesis that present-day deep mantle melting creates ULVZs and introduces compositional heterogeneity in the mantle. Our models explore the generation and migration of melt in a deforming and compacting host rock at the base of a plume in the lowermost mantle. We test whether the balance of gravitational and viscous forces can generate partially molten zones that are consistent with the seismic observations. We find that for a wide range of plausible melt densities, permeabilities and viscosities, lower mantle melt is too dense to be stirred into convective flow and instead sinks down to form a completely molten layer, which is inconsistent with observations of ULVZs. Only if melt is less dense or at most ca. 1 per cent more dense than the solid, or if melt pockets are trapped within the solid, can melt remain suspended in the partial melt zone. In these cases, seismic velocities would be reduced in a cone at the base of the plume. Generally, we find partial melt alone does not explain the observed ULVZ morphologies and solid-state compositional variation is required to explain the anomalies. Our findings provide a framework for testing whether seismically observed ULVZ shapes are consistent with a partial melt origin, which is an important step towards constraining the nature of the heterogeneities in the lowermost mantle and their influence on the thermal, compositional and dynamic evolution of the Earth.},

Using high frequency synthetic seismograms we have systematically examined the effect of a one-dimensional melt layer at the CMB on the global seismic wavefield. We find that PKKP diffracted waves are an extremely sensitive, robust and previously underutilised seismic phase for studying the CMB and, in synthetic testing, could resolve very thin melt layers. We have constructed a global data set of PKKP diffracted observations to attempt to observe or exclude melt at the CMB. We find that within the bounds of our data, we are unable to robustly exclude or observe a melt layer at the CMB on the order of single kilometres thick.

This estimate assumes a compositionally homogeneous Martian mantle, at odds with recent measurements of anomalously slow propagating P waves diffracted along the core–mantle boundary2. An alternative hypothesis is that Mars’s mantle is heterogeneous as a consequence of an early magma ocean that solidified to form a basal layer enriched in iron and heat-producing elements. Such enrichment results in the formation of a molten silicate layer above the core, overlain by a partially molten layer3. Here we show that this structure is compatible with all geophysical data, notably (1) deep reflected and diffracted mantle seismic phases, (2) weak shear attenuation at seismic frequency and (3) Mars’s dissipative nature at Phobos tides. The core size in this scenario is 1,650 ± 20 km, implying a density of 6.5 g cm−3, 5–8\% larger than previous seismic estimates, and can be explained by fewer, and less abundant, alloying light elements than previously required, in amounts compatible with experimental and cosmochemical constraints. Finally, the layered mantle structure requires external sources to generate the magnetic signatures recorded in Mars’s crust.},

Core compositions based on seismic and bulk geophysical constraints, however, require larger quantities of the volatile elements hydrogen, carbon and sulfur than those that were cosmochemically available in the likely building blocks of Mars4. Here we show that multiply diffracted P waves along a stratified core–mantle boundary region of Mars in combination with first-principles computations of the thermoelastic properties of liquid iron-rich alloys3 require the presence of a fully molten silicate layer overlying a smaller, denser liquid core. Inverting differential body wave travel time data with particular sensitivity to the core–mantle boundary region suggests a decreased core radius of 1,675 ± 30 km associated with an increased density of 6.65 ± 0.1 g cm−3, relative to previous models2,4–8, while the thickness and density of the molten silicate layer are 150 ± 15 km and 4.05 ± 0.05 g cm−3, respectively.

A fully molten Moon may crystallize neutrally buoyant olivine, whose accumulation may form a barrier leading to a separation into two independently evolving melt reservoirs. This study investigates the crystallization of such a putative basal lunar magma ocean, ranging from the core mantle boundary (with radius r = 380 km) to the level of neutral olivine buoyancy (r = 600 km). Consecutive crystallization experiments determine liquidus temperatures and crystallize 10–30 wt\% minerals, before conceptually segregating these according to their buoyancy, and then stepping to a new bulk composition that corresponds to the residual melt after removal of the cumulate minerals. The first olivine to crystallize from a Taylor Whole Moon composition (twm, XMg = Mg/(Mg + Fe2+) = 0.83) has XMg = 0.94 and is neutrally buoyant at 3.8 GPa according to the melt density model of Lange and Carmichael (1990). Crystallization begins at the core mantle boundary, but early olivine floats and re-dissolves until the magma ocean cools to the liquidus temperature at the depth of neutral buoyancy (1850 °C). At this point a {\textgreater} 500 km thick olivine-only layer could form, mainly fed from the upper magma shell. The crystallization sequence in the basal magma ocean is olivine-only at 1850–1675 °C, 0–26 pcs (wt\% percent solidified) → olivine + opx (to 1600 °C, 42 pcs) → opx + cpx + garnet (to 1580 °C, 60 pcs) → cpx + garnet (to 1520 °C, 73 pcs) → cpx + garnet + olivine leaving 11 wt\% residual melt at 1450 °C. Cooling this last melt to 1300 °C leads to 80\% garnet + cpx + olivine + Ti-spinel, the residual liquid corresponding to 2.2\% of the basal magma ocean. Olivine, opx and cpx remain buoyant over the entire crystallization interval and various pyroxenite layers are added to the olivine layer. Garnet and the final cotectic cpx + garnet + olivine + FeTi-oxide assemblage instead form a 70 km thick basal layer on the core-mantle boundary. Such a layer provides a gravitationally stable high-density lowermost lunar mantle, which would concur with a recent re-analysis of the lunar seismic data. The lowest temperature experiment at 1300 °C, not much above the 1250 °C proposed for the core-mantle boundary from inversion of geophysical data, had about 20\% of a highly evolved, dense Fe-rich melt. It is feasible that this melt has remained in its liquid state to present day, providing an explanation for the proposed low vp and vs layer and high dissipation just above the core-mantle boundary.},

Models of sub-Alfvénic SPIs predict that terrestrial planets in close-in orbits around M dwarfs can induce detectable stellar radio emission, manifesting as bursts of strongly polarized coherent radiation observable at specific planet orbital positions. Here we present 2–4 GHz detections of coherent radio bursts on the slowly rotating M dwarf YZ Ceti, which hosts a compact system of terrestrial planets, the innermost of which orbits with a two-day period. Two coherent bursts occur at similar orbital phases of YZ Ceti b, suggestive of an enhanced probability of bursts near that orbital phase. We model the system’s magnetospheric environment in the context of sub-Alfvénic SPIs and determine that YZ Ceti b can plausibly power the observed flux densities of the radio detections. However, we cannot rule out stellar magnetic activity without a well-characterized rate of non-planet-induced coherent radio bursts on slow rotators. YZ Ceti is therefore a candidate radio SPI system, with unique promise as a target for long-term monitoring.},

	abstract = {Scaling laws for planetary dynamos relate the characteristic magnetic field strength, characteristic flow velocity and other properties to primary quantities such as core size, rotation rate, electrical conductivity and heat flux. Many different scaling laws have been proposed, often relying on the assumption of a balance of Coriolis force and Lorentz force in the dynamo. Their theoretical foundation is reviewed. The advent of direct numerical simulations of planetary dynamos and the ability to perform them for a sufficiently wide range of control parameters allows to test the scaling laws. The results support a magnetic field scaling that is not based on a force balance, but on the energy flux available to balance ohmic dissipation. In its simplest form, it predicts a field strength that is independent of rotation rate and electrical conductivity and proportional to the cubic root of the available energy flux. However, rotation rate controls whether the magnetic field is dipolar or multipolar. Scaling laws for velocity, heat transfer and ohmic dissipation are also discussed. The predictions of the energy-based scaling law agree well with the observed field strength of Earth and Jupiter, but for other planets they are more difficult to test or special pleading is required to explain their field strength. The scaling law also explains the very high field strength of rapidly rotating low-mass stars, which supports its rather general validity.},

	abstract = {The magnetic fields of the solar system’s planets provide valuable insights into their interiors and can have dramatic consequences for the evolution of their atmospheres and interaction with the solar wind. However, we have little direct knowledge of magnetic fields in exoplanets. Here we present a method for detecting magnetic fields in the atmospheres of close-in exoplanets based on spectropolarimetric transit observations at the wavelength of the helium line at 1083 nm. This methodology has been successfully applied for exploring magnetic fields in solar coronal filaments. Strong absorption signatures (transit depths on the order of a few percent) in the 1083 nm line have recently been observed for several close-in exoplanets. We show that in the conditions in these escaping atmospheres, metastable helium atoms should be optically pumped by the starlight and, for field strengths more than a few × 10−4 G, should align with the magnetic field. This results in linearly polarized absorption at 1083 nm that traces the field direction (the Hanle effect), which we explore by both analytic computation and the Hazel numerical code. The linear polarization ranges from ∼10−3 in optimistic cases down to a few × 10−5 for particularly unfavorable cases, with very weak dependence on field strength. The line-of-sight component of the field results in a slight circular polarization (the Zeeman effect), also reaching . We discuss the detectability of these signals with current (SPIRou) and future (Extremely Large Telescope) high-resolution infrared spectropolarimeters, and we briefly comment on possible sources of astrophysical contamination.},

The high pressures and temperatures in their interiors are likely to lead to long-lived magma oceans. If their electrical conductivity is sufficiently high, the mantles of Super-Earth would generate their own magnetic fields. With ab initio simulations, we show that upon melting, the behavior of typical mantle silicates changes from semi-conducting to semi-metallic. The electrical conductivity increases and the optical properties are substantially modified. Melting could thus be detected with high-precision reflectivity measurements during the short time scales of shock experiments. We estimate the electrical conductivity of mantle silicates to be of the order of 100 Ω−1 cm−1, which implies that a magnetic dynamo process would develop in the magma oceans of Super-Earths if their convective velocities have typical values of 1 mm/s or higher. We predict exoplanets with rotation periods longer than 2 days to have multipolar magnetic fields.},

	abstract = {The “new core paradox” suggests that the persistence of the geomagnetic field over nearly all of Earth history is in conflict with the core being highly thermally conductive, which makes convection and dynamo action in the core much harder prior to the nucleation of the inner core. Here we revisit this issue by exploring the influence of six important parameters on core evolution: upper/lower mantle viscosity ratio, core thermal conductivity, core radiogenic heat rate, mantle radiogenic heating rate, central core melting temperature, and initial core-mantle boundary (CMB) temperature. Each parameter is systematically explored by the model, which couples mantle energy and core energy-entropy evolution. A model is “successful” if the correct present-day inner core size is achieved and the dynamo remains alive, as implied by the paleomagnetic record. In agreement with previous studies, we do not find successful thermal evolutions using nominal parameters, which includes a core thermal conductivity of 70 Wm−1K−1, zero core radioactivity, and an initial CMB temperature of 5,000 K. The dynamo can be kept alive by assuming an unrealistically low thermal conductivity of 20 Wm−1K−1 or an unrealistically high core radioactive heat flow of 3 TW at present-day, which are considered “unsuccessful” models. We identify a third scenario to keep the dynamo alive by assuming a hot initial CMB temperature of ∼6,000 K and a central core liquidus of ∼5,550 K. These temperatures are on the extreme end of typical estimates, but should not be ruled out and deserve further scrutiny.},

The analysis of core-reflected waveforms with rigorous estimation of Bayesian uncertainties shows strong evidence of stratified density increases ({\textasciitilde}30\%) and shear-wave velocity decreases ({\textasciitilde}50\%) within the ultralow-velocity zones. These zones thin on two sides and occur at the edge of the Pacific large low-shear-velocity province. Geodynamic modelling demonstrates that these features are consistent with the presence of compositional heterogeneities within the ultralow-velocity zones that may be caused by the remnants of Earth’s early differentiation. We conclude that small-scale structures that are compositionally distinct from their surroundings reside at the bottom of the mantle without full homogenization, throughout Earth’s history.},

	abstract = {The recent inference of a carbon-rich atmosphere, with C/O {\textgreater}= 1, in the hot Jupiter WASP-12b motivates the exotic new class of carbon-rich planets (CRPs). We report a detailed study of the atmospheric chemistry and spectroscopic signatures of carbon-rich giant planets (CRGs) and the compositions of icy planetesimals required for their formation, and the apportionment of ices, rock, and volatiles in their envelopes. For C/O {\textgreater}= 1, most of the atmospheric oxygen is occupied by CO for T {\textgreater} 1400 K and pressure (P) {\textless} 1 bar, causing a substantial depletion in H2O, and an overabundance of CH4 compared to those obtained by assuming solar abundances (C/O = 0.54) in chemical equilibrium. These differences in chemistry cause distinctly observable signatures in spectra. We also find that a C/O {\textgreater}= 1 strongly depletes the abundances of TiO and VO available to form thermal inversions, which is adequate to rule out thermal inversions due to TiO/VO even in the most highly irradiated hot Jupiters, such as WASP-12b. Adopting stellar abundances (C/O = 0.44) for the primordial disk composition and low-temperature formation conditions (T {\textless}= 30 K) for WASP-12b leads to a C/O ratio of 0.27 in accreted planetesimals, and, consequently, in the planet's envelope. In contrast, a C/O ratio of 1 in the envelope of WASP-12b requires a substantial depletion of oxygen in the disk, by a factor of {\textasciitilde}0.41 for the same formation conditions. This scenario also satisfies the constraints on the C/H and O/H ratios reported for WASP-12b. If, alternatively, hotter conditions prevailed in a stellar composition disk such that only H2O is condensed, the remaining gas can potentially have a C/O {\textasciitilde} 1. However, a high C/O in WASP-12b caused predominantly by gas accretion would preclude super-stellar C/H ratios which also fit the data.},

	abstract = {Exoplanet transmission spectra provide rich information about the chemical composition, clouds and temperature structure of exoplanet atmospheres. Most exoplanet transmission spectra only span infrared wavelengths (\${\textbackslash}gtrsim\$ 1 \${\textbackslash}rm\{{\textbackslash}mu m\}\$), which can preclude crucial atmospheric information from shorter wavelengths. Here, we explore how retrieved atmospheric parameters from exoplanet transmission spectra change with the addition of optical data. From a sample of 14 giant planets with transit spectra from 0.3-4.5 \${\textbackslash}rm\{{\textbackslash}mu m\}\$, primarily from the Hubble and Spitzer space telescopes, we apply a free chemistry retrieval to planetary spectra for wavelength ranges of 0.3-4.5 \${\textbackslash}rm\{{\textbackslash}mu m\}\$, 0.6-4.5 \${\textbackslash}rm\{{\textbackslash}mu m\}\$, and 1.1-4.5 \${\textbackslash}rm\{{\textbackslash}mu m\}\$. We analyse the posterior distributions of these retrievals and perform an information content analysis, finding wavelengths below 0.6 \${\textbackslash}rm\{{\textbackslash}mu m\}\$ are necessary to constrain cloud scattering slope parameters (\${\textbackslash}log\{a\}\$ and \${\textbackslash}gamma\$) and alkali species Na and K. There is limited improvement in the constraints on the remaining atmospheric parameters. Across the population, we find limb temperatures are retrieved colder than planetary equilibrium temperatures but have an overall good agreement with Global Circulation Models. As JWST extends to a minimum wavelength of 0.6 \${\textbackslash}rm\{{\textbackslash}mu m\}\$, we demonstrate that exploration into complementing JWST observations with optical HST data is important to further our understanding of aerosol properties and alkali abundances in exoplanet atmospheres.},

The thousands of exoplanets discovered over the past decade have most recently been supplemented by discoveries of potentially habitable planets around nearby low-mass stars. Currently, the field is rapidly progressing toward detailed spectroscopic observations to characterize the atmospheres of these planets. Various surveys from space and the ground are expected to detect numerous more exoplanets orbiting nearby stars that make the planets conducive for atmospheric characterization. The current state of this frontier of exoplanetary atmospheres may be summarized as follows. We have entered the era of comparative exoplanetology thanks to high-fidelity atmospheric observations now available for tens of exoplanets. Recent studies reveal a rich diversity of chemical compositions and atmospheric processes hitherto unseen in the Solar System. Elemental abundances of exoplanetary atmospheres place important constraints on exoplanetary formation and migration histories. Upcoming observational facilities promise to revolutionize exoplanetary spectroscopy down to rocky exoplanets. The detection of a biosignature in an exoplanetary atmosphere is conceivable over the next decade. In the present review, we discuss the modern and future landscape of this frontier area of exoplanetary atmospheres. We start with a brief review of the area, emphasising the key insights gained from different observationalmethods and theoretical studies. This is followed by an in-depth discussion of the state of the art, challenges, and future prospects in three forefront branches of the area.},

	abstract = {Exoplanetary atmospheric retrieval refers to the inference of atmospheric properties of an exoplanet given an observed spectrum. The atmospheric properties include the chemical compositions, temperature profiles, clouds/hazes, and energy circulation. These properties, in turn, can provide key insights into the atmospheric physicochemical processes of exoplanets as well as their formation mechanisms. Major advancements in atmospheric retrieval have been made in the last decade, thanks to a combination of state-of-the-art spectroscopic observations and advanced atmospheric modeling and statistical inference methods. These developments have already resulted in key constraints on the atmospheric H2O abundances, temperature profiles, and other properties for several exoplanets. Upcoming facilities such as the JWST will further advance this area. The present chapter is a pedagogical review of this exciting frontier of exoplanetary science. The principles of atmospheric retrievals of exoplanets are discussed in detail, including parametric models and statistical inference methods, along with a review of key results in the field. Some of the main challenges in retrievals with current observations are discussed along with new directions and the future landscape.},

	abstract = {We present Hubble Space Telescope (HST) optical and near-ultraviolet transmission spectra of the transiting hot Jupiter HD 189733b, taken with the repaired Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) instrument. The resulting spectra cover the range 2900-5700 Å and reach per exposure signal-to-noise ratio levels greater than 11 000 within a 500-Å bandwidth. We used time series spectra obtained during two transit events to determine the wavelength dependence of the planetary radius and measure the exoplanet's atmospheric transmission spectrum for the first time over this wavelength range. Our measurements, in conjunction with existing HST spectra, now provide a broad-band transmission spectrum covering the full optical regime. The STIS data also show unambiguous evidence of a large occulted stellar spot during one of our transit events, which we use to place constraints on the characteristics of the K dwarf's stellar spots, estimating spot temperatures around Teff∼ 4250 K. With contemporaneous ground-based photometric monitoring of the stellar variability, we also measure the correlation between the stellar activity level and transit-measured planet-to-star radius contrast, which is in good agreement with predictions. We find a planetary transmission spectrum in good agreement with that of Rayleigh scattering from a high-altitude atmospheric haze as previously found from HST Advanced Camera for Surveys. The high-altitude haze is now found to cover the entire optical regime and is well characterized by Rayleigh scattering. These findings suggest that haze may be a globally dominant atmospheric feature of the planet which would result in a high optical albedo at shorter optical wavelengths.},

	abstract = {Using the new Cosmic Origins Spectrograph on the Hubble Space Telescope, we obtained moderate-resolution, high signal/noise ultraviolet spectra of HD 209458 and its exoplanet HD 209458b during transit, both orbital quadratures, and secondary eclipse. We compare transit spectra with spectra obtained at non-transit phases to identify spectral features due to the exoplanet's expanding atmosphere. We find that the mean flux decreased by 7.8\% ± 1.3\% for the C II 1334.5323 Å and 1335.6854 Å lines and by 8.2\% ± 1.4\% for the Si III 1206.500 Å line during transit compared to non-transit times in the velocity interval -50 to +50 km s-1. Comparison of the C II and Si III line depths and transit/non-transit line ratios shows deeper absorption features near -10 and +15 km s-1 and less certain features near -40 and +30-70 km s-1, but future observations are needed to verify this first detection of velocity structure in the expanding atmosphere of an exoplanet. Our results for the C II lines and the non-detection of Si IV 1394.76 Å absorption are in agreement with Vidal-Madjar et al., but we find absorption during transit in the Si III line contrary to the earlier result. The 8\% ± 1\% obscuration of the star during transit is far larger than the 1.5\% obscuration by the exoplanet's disk. Absorption during transit at velocities between -50 and +50 km s-1 in the C II and Si III lines requires high-velocity ion absorbers. Assuming hydrodynamic model values for the gas temperature and outflow velocity at the limb of the outflow as seen in the C II lines, we find mass-loss rates in the range (8-40)×1010 g s-1. These rates assume that the carbon abundance is solar, which is not the case for the giant planets in the solar system. Our mass-loss rate estimate is consistent with theoretical hydrodynamic models that include metals in the outflowing gas.

By dividing the target and reference star into 19 spectroscopic passbands and applying differential spectrophotometry, we derive spectroscopic transit light curves and fit them using a Gaussian process framework to determine transit depths for every passband. The obtained optical transmission spectrum shows a steep increased slope toward the blue wavelength, which seems to be too steep to be accounted for by Rayleigh scattering alone. We note that the transmission spectrum from this work and other works differ obviously from each other, which was pointed out previously by Wilson et al. as evidence for temporal atmospheric variation. We perform a free chemistry retrieval analysis on the optical transmission spectra from this work and the literature HST/WFC3 NIR spectrum. We determine TiO, VO and H2O with abundances of \$-\{5.95\}\_\{-0.42\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.47\}\$ dex, \$-\{6.72\}\_\{-1.79\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.51\}\$ dex and \$-\{4.13\}\_\{-0.46\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.63\}\$ dex, respectively. We compare the abundances of all three of these molecules derived from this work and previous works, and find that they are not consistent with each other, indicating the chemical compositions of the terminator region may change over long timescales. Future multi-epoch and high-precision transit observations are required to further confirm this phenomenon. We note that when combining the transmission spectra in the optical and in NIR in retrieval analysis, the abundances of V and VO, the NIR-to-optical offset and the cloud deck pressure may be coupled with each other.},

	abstract = {We present an atmospheric transmission spectrum for the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-121b, measured using the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph on board the Hubble Space Telescope. Across the 0.47–1 wavelength range, the data imply an atmospheric opacity comparable to—and in some spectroscopic channels exceeding—that previously measured at near-infrared wavelengths (1.15–1.65 ). Wavelength-dependent variations in the opacity rule out a gray cloud deck at a confidence level of 3.7σ and may instead be explained by VO spectral bands. We find a cloud-free model assuming chemical equilibrium for a temperature of 1500 K and a metal enrichment of 10–30× solar matches these data well. Using a free-chemistry retrieval analysis, we estimate a VO abundance of dex. We find no evidence for TiO and place a 3σ upper limit of −7.9 dex on its abundance, suggesting TiO may have condensed from the gas phase at the day–night limb. The opacity rises steeply at the shortest wavelengths, increasing by approximately five pressure scale heights from 0.47 to 0.3 in wavelength. If this feature is caused by Rayleigh scattering due to uniformly distributed aerosols, it would imply an unphysically high temperature of 6810 ± 1530 K. One alternative explanation for the short-wavelength rise is absorption due to SH (mercapto radical), which has been predicted as an important product of non-equilibrium chemistry in hot Jupiter atmospheres. Irrespective of the identity of the NUV absorber, it likely captures a significant amount of incident stellar radiation at low pressures, thus playing a significant role in the overall energy budget, thermal structure, and circulation of the atmosphere.},

	abstract = {Context.
              Two independent investigations of the atmosphere of the hot Jupiter HAT-P-12b by two different groups resulted in discrepant solutions. Using broad-band photometry from the ground, one study found a flat and featureless transmission spectrum that was interpreted as gray absorption by dense cloud coverage. The second study made use of
              Hubble
              Space Telescope (HST) observations and found Rayleigh scattering at optical wavelengths caused by haze.


              Aims.
              The main purpose of this work is to determine the source of this inconsistency and provide feedback to prevent similar discrepancies in future analyses of other exoplanetary atmospheres.


              Methods.
              We studied the observed discrepancy via two methods. With further broad-band observations in the optical wavelength regions, we strengthened the previous measurements in precision, and with a homogeneous reanalysis of the published data, we were able to assess the systematic errors and the independent analyses of the two different groups.


              Results.
              Repeating the analysis steps of both works, we found that deviating values for the orbital parameters are the reason for the aforementioned discrepancy. Our work showed a degeneracy of the planetary spectral slope with these parameters. In a homogeneous reanalysis of all data, the two literature data sets and the new observations converge to a consistent transmission spectrum, showing a low-amplitude spectral slope and a tentative detection of potassium absorption.},

HAT-P-1b has solutions that fall into both categories. WASP-6b, HAT-P-12b, HD 189733b, and WASP-12b must have aerosol extending to low atmospheric pressures (below 0.1 mbar). In general, planets with equilibrium temperatures between 1300 and 1700 K are best represented by deeper, gray cloud layers, whereas cooler or hotter planets are better fit using high Rayleigh scattering aerosol. We find little evidence for the presence of molecular absorbers other than H{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}O.

The spectrum covers 0.3-1.7 μm at a resolution R ∼ 70, which we combine with Spitzer photometry to cover the full-optical to IR. The spectrum is dominated by a cloud deck with a flat transmission spectrum which is apparent at wavelengths {\textgreater} 0.52 μm. The cloud deck is present at high altitudes and low pressures, as it covers the majority of the expected optical Na line and near-IR H2O features. While Na I absorption is not clearly identified, the resulting spectrum does show a very strong potassium feature detected at the 4.2σ confidence level. Broadened alkali wings are not detected, indicating pressures below ∼10 mbar. The lack of Na and strong K is the first indication of a sub-solar Na/K abundance ratio in a planetary atmosphere (ln[Na/K] = -3.3 ± 2.8), which could potentially be explained by Na condensation on the planet's night side, or primordial abundance variations. A strong Rayleigh scattering signature is detected at short wavelengths, with a 4σ significant slope. Two distinct aerosol size populations can explain the spectra, with a smaller sub-micron size grain population reaching high altitudes producing a blue Rayleigh scattering signature on top of a larger, lower lying population responsible for the flat cloud deck at longer wavelengths. We estimate that the atmospheric circulation is sufficiently strong to mix micron size particles upwards to the required 1-10 mbar pressures, necessary to explain the cloud deck. These results further confirm the importance of clouds in hot Jupiters, which can potentially dominate the overall spectra and may alter the abundances of key gaseous species.},

Previous observations of the hot Jupiter WASP-31b using transmission spectroscopy at low resolution have presented conflicting results. Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations detected a strong potassium feature at high significance (4.2σ), which subsequent ground-based spectrophotometry with the Very Large Telescope (VLT) failed to reproduce. Here, we present high-resolution observations (\$R{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}gt {\textbackslash}, 80{\textbackslash}, 000\$) of WASP-31b with the UVES spectrograph, in an effort to resolve this discrepancy. We perform a comprehensive search for potassium using differential transit light curves, and integration over the planet’s radial velocity. Our observations do not detect K absorption at the level previously reported with HST, consistent with the VLT observations. We measure a differential light curve depth ΔF = 0.00031 ± 0.00036 using 40 Å bins centred on the planet’s K feature, and set an upper limit on the core line depth of ΔF ≤ 0.007 (3σ) at a few times the resolution limit (≈0.24 Å). These results demonstrate that there are still significant limitations to our understanding of instrumental systematics even with our most stable space-based instrumentation, and that care must be taken when extracting narrow band signatures from low-resolution data. Confirming exoplanet features using alternative instruments and methodologies should be a priority, and confronting the limitations of systematics is essential to our future understanding of exoplanet atmospheres.},

	abstract = {Transmission spectroscopy provides a powerful probe of the atmospheric properties of transiting exoplanets. To date, studies of exoplanets in transit have focused on inferring their atmospheric properties such as chemical compositions, cloud/haze properties, and temperature structures. However, surface inhomogeneities in the host stars of exoplanets in the form of cool spots and hot faculae can in principle imprint signatures on the observed planetary transit spectrum. Here we present Aura, a new retrieval paradigm for inferring both planetary and stellar properties from a transmission spectrum. We apply our retrieval framework to a sample of hot giant exoplanets to determine the significance of stellar heterogeneity and clouds/hazes in their spectra. The retrieval analyses distinguish four groups of planets. First, the spectra of WASP-6b and WASP-39b are best characterized by imprints of stellar heterogeneity and hazes and/or clouds. HD 209458b and HAT-P-12b comprise the second group for which there is weak evidence for stellar heterogeneity and a high significance of hazes and/or clouds. The third group constitutes HAT-P-1b and WASP-31b and shows weak evidence against stellar heterogeneity but weak to substantial indications of clouds/hazes. The fourth group – WASP-19b, WASP-17b, and WASP-12b – is fit best by molecular and alkali absorbers with H2 scattering without evidence for stellar heterogeneity and weak to no evidence for clouds/hazes. Our retrieval methodology paves the way to simultaneous information on the star and planet from higher resolution spectra using future facilities such as the James Webb Space Telescope and large ground-based facilities.},

	abstract = {For solar system objects, ultraviolet spectroscopy has been critical in identifying sources of stratospheric heating and measuring the abundances of a variety of hydrocarbon and sulfur-bearing species, produced via photochemical mechanisms, as well as oxygen and ozone. To date, fewer than 20 exoplanets have been probed in this critical wavelength range (0.2–0.4 μm). Here we use data from Hubble’s newly implemented WFC3 UVIS G280 grism to probe the atmosphere of the hot Jupiter HAT-P-41b in the ultraviolet through optical in combination with observations at infrared wavelengths. We analyze and interpret HAT-P-41b’s 0.2–5.0 μm transmission spectrum using a broad range of methodologies including multiple treatments of data systematics as well as comparisons with atmospheric forward, cloud microphysical, and multiple atmospheric retrieval models. Although some analysis and interpretation methods favor the presence of clouds or potentially a combination of Na, VO, AlO, and CrH to explain the ultraviolet through optical portions of HAT-P-41b’s transmission spectrum, we find that the presence of a significant H− opacity provides the most robust explanation. We obtain a constraint for the abundance of H−, , in HAT-P-41b’s atmosphere, which is several orders of magnitude larger than predictions from equilibrium chemistry for a ∼1700–1950 K hot Jupiter. We show that a combination of photochemical and collisional processes on hot hydrogen-dominated exoplanets can readily supply the necessary amount of H− and suggest that such processes are at work in HAT-P-41b and the atmospheres of many other hot Jupiters.},

We begin with a discussion of the properties of exoplanetary systems that allow us to measure exoplanetary spectra, and the principles that underlie transit techniques. Subsequently, we discuss the most favorable wavelengths for observing, and explain the speciﬁc techniques of secondary eclipses and eclipse mapping, phase curves, transit spectroscopy, and convolution with spectral templates. Our discussion includes factors that affect the data acquisition, and also a separate discussion of how the results are interpreted. Other important topics that we cover include statistical methods to characterize atmospheres such as stacking, and the effects of stellar activity.

This promising science from JWST, however, will require exquisite precision and understanding of systematic errors that can impact the time series of planets crossing in front of and behind their host stars. Here, we provide estimates of the random noise sources affecting JWST NIRCam time-series data on the integration-to-integration level. We find that 1/f noise can limit the precision of grism time series for 2 groups (230 ppm to 1000 ppm depending on the extraction method and extraction parameters), but will average down like the square root of N frames/reads. The current NIRCam grism time series mode is especially affected by 1/f noise because its GRISMR dispersion direction is parallel to the detector fast-read direction, but could be alleviated in the GRISMC direction. Care should be taken to include as many frames as possible per visit to reduce this 1/f noise source: thus, we recommend the smallest detector subarray sizes one can tolerate, 4 output channels and readout modes that minimize the number of skipped frames (RAPID or BRIGHT2). We also describe a covariance weighting scheme that can significantly lower the contributions from 1/f noise as compared to sum extraction. We evaluate the noise introduced by pre-amplifier offsets, random telegraph noise, and high dark current RC pixels and find that these are correctable below 10 ppm once background subtraction and pixel masking are performed. We explore systematic error sources in a companion paper.},

              We report on James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) commissioning observations of the transiting exoplanet HAT-P-14 b, obtained using the Bright Object Time Series (BOTS) mode of the NIRSpec instrument with the G395H/F290LP grating/filter combination (3–5
              μ
              m). While the data were used primarily to verify that the NIRSpec BOTS mode is working as expected, and to enable it for general scientific use, they yield a precise transmission spectrum which we find is featureless down to the precision level of the instrument, consistent with expectations given HAT-P-14 b’s small scale-height and hence expected atmospheric features. The exquisite quality and stability of the JWST/NIRSpec transit spectrum—almost devoid of any systematic effects—allowed us to obtain median uncertainties of 50–60 ppm in this wavelength range at a resolution of
              R
              = 100 in a single exposure, which is in excellent agreement with pre-flight expectations and close to the (or at the) photon-noise limit for a

              = 9.094, F-type star like HAT-P-14. These observations showcase the ability of NIRSpec/BOTS to perform cutting-edge transiting exoplanet atmospheric science, setting the stage for observations and discoveries to be made in Cycle 1 and beyond.},

Current methods for detecting the rotation period of exoplanets are not suitable for terrestrial exoplanets. Here we demonstrate that, under certain conditions, the rotation period of an Earth-like exoplanet will be detectable using direct-imaging techniques. We use a global climate model that includes clouds to simulate reﬂected starlight from an Earth-like exoplanet and explore how different parameters (e.g., orbital geometry, wavelength, time resolution) inﬂuence the detectability of the planet’s rotation period. We show that the rotation period of an Earth-like exoplanet is detectable using visible-wavelength channels with time-series monitoring at a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) {\textgreater}20 with ∼5–15 rotation periods of data, while the rotation period of a planet with full ocean coverage is unlikely to be detectable. To better detect the rotation period, one needs to plan the observation so that each individual integration would yield a S/N {\textgreater}10, while keeping the integration time shorter than 1/6 to 1/4 of the rotation period of the planet. Our results provide important guidance for rotation period detection of Earth-like exoplanets in reﬂected light using future space telescopes.},

	abstract = {Potentially habitable planets can orbit close enough to their host star that the differential gravity across their diameters can produce an elongated shape. Frictional forces inside the planet prevent the bulges from aligning perfectly with the host star and result in torques that alter the planet’s rotational angular momentum. Eventually the tidal torques fix the rotation rate at a specific frequency, a process called tidal locking. Tidally locked planets on circular orbits will rotate synchronously, but those on eccentric orbits will either librate or rotate super-synchronously. Although these features of tidal theory are well known, a systematic survey of the rotational evolution of potentially habitable exoplanets using classic equilibrium tide theories has not been undertaken. I calculate how habitable planets evolve under two commonly used models and find, for example, that one model predicts that the Earth’s rotation rate would have synchronized after 4.5 Gyr if its initial rotation period was 3 days, it had no satellites, and it always maintained the modern Earth’s tidal properties. Lower mass stellar hosts will induce stronger tidal effects on potentially habitable planets, and tidal locking is possible for most planets in the habitable zones of GKM dwarf stars. For fast-rotating planets, both models predict eccentricity growth and that circularization can only occur once the rotational frequency is similar to the orbital frequency. The orbits of potentially habitable planets of very late M dwarfs () are very likely to be circularized within 1 Gyr, and hence, those planets will be synchronous rotators. Proxima b is almost assuredly tidally locked, but its orbit may not have circularized yet, so the planet could be rotating super-synchronously today. The evolution of the isolated and potentially habitable Kepler planet candidates is computed and about half could be tidally locked. Finally, projected TESS planets are simulated over a wide range of assumptions, and the vast majority of potentially habitable cases are found to tidally lock within 1 Gyr. These results suggest that the process of tidal locking is a major factor in the evolution of most of the potentially habitable exoplanets to be discovered in the near future.},

	abstract = {Context. The nearby ultra-compact multiplanetary system YZ Ceti consists of at least three planets, and a fourth tentative signal. The orbital period of each planet is the subject of discussion in the literature due to strong aliasing in the radial velocity data. The stellar activity of this M dwarf also hampers significantly the derivation of the planetary parameters. Aims: With an additional 229 radial velocity measurements obtained since the discovery publication, we reanalyze the YZ Ceti system and resolve the alias issues. Methods: We use model comparison in the framework of Bayesian statistics and periodogram simulations based on a method by Dawson and Fabrycky to resolve the aliases. We discuss additional signals in the RV data, and derive the planetary parameters by simultaneously modeling the stellar activity with a Gaussian process regression model. To constrain the planetary parameters further we apply a stability analysis on our ensemble of Keplerian fits. Results: We find no evidence for a fourth possible companion. We resolve the aliases: the three planets orbit the star with periods of 2.02 d, 3.06 d, and 4.66 d. We also investigate an effect of the stellar rotational signal on the derivation of the planetary parameters, in particular the eccentricity of the innermost planet. Using photometry we determine the stellar rotational period to be close to 68 d and we also detect this signal in the residuals of a three-planet fit to the RV data and the spectral activity indicators. From our stability analysis we derive a lower limit on the inclination of the system with the assumption of coplanar orbits which is imin = 0.9 deg. From the absence of a transit event with TESS, we derive an upper limit of the inclination of imax = 87.43 deg. Conclusions: YZ Ceti is a prime example of a system where strong aliasing hindered the determination of the orbital periods of exoplanets. Additionally, stellar activity influences the derivation of planetary parameters and modeling them correctly is important for the reliable estimation of the orbital parameters in this specific compact system. Stability considerations then allow additional constraints to be placed on the planetary parameters.

	abstract = {Exoplanet surveys have shown that systems with multiple low-mass planets on compact orbits are common. Except for a few cases, however, the masses of these planets are generally unknown. At the very end of the main sequence, host stars have the lowest mass and hence offer the largest reflect motion for a given planet. In this context, we monitored the low-mass (0.13 M⊙) M dwarf YZ Cet (GJ 54.1, HIP 5643) intensively and obtained radial velocities and stellar-activity indicators derived from spectroscopy and photometry, respectively. We find strong evidence that it is orbited by at least three planets in compact orbits (POrb = 1.97, 3.06, 4.66 days), with the inner two near a 2:3 mean-motion resonance. The minimum masses are comparable to the mass of Earth (M sin I = 0.75 ± 0.13, 0.98 ± 0.14, and 1.14 ± 0.17 M⊕), and they are also the lowest masses measured by radial velocity so far. We note the possibility for a fourth planet with an even lower mass of M sin I = 0.472 ± 0.096 M⊕ at POrb = 1.04 days. An n-body dynamical model is used to place further constraints on the system parameters. At 3.6 parsecs, YZ Cet is the nearest multi-planet system detected to date.

Ohmic heating influences the contraction of gas giants in two ways: by direct heating within the convection zone and by heating outside the convection zone, which increases the effective insulation of the interior. We calculate these effects and show that internal ohmic heating is only able to slow the contraction rate of a cooling gas giant once the planet reaches a critical value of internal entropy. We determine the age of the gas giant when ohmic heating becomes important as a function of mass, Tiso, and induced Bϕ0. With this survey of parameter space complete, we then adopt the wind zone scalings of Menou and calculate the expected evolution of gas giants with different levels of irradiation. We find that, with this prescription of magnetic drag, it is difficult to inflate massive planets or those with strong irradiation using ohmic heating, meaning that we are unable to account for many of the observed hot Jupiter radii. This is in contrast to previous evolutionary models that assumed that a constant fraction of the irradiation is transformed into ohmic power.},

The aCeTY line list covers the transition wavenumbers up to 10,000 cm\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ (\$ {\textbackslash}lambda {\textgreater}1\$ \${\textbackslash}mu\$m), with lower and upper energy levels up to 12,000 cm\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ and 22,000 cm\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ considered, respectively. The calculations are performed up to a maximum value for the vibrational angular momentum, \$K\_\{{\textbackslash}rm max\}=L\_\{{\textbackslash}rm max\}\$ = 16, and maximum rotational angular momentum, \$J\$ = 99. Higher values of \$J\$ were not within the specified wavenumber window. The aCeTY line list is considered to be complete up to 2200 K, making it suitable for use in characterising high-temperature exoplanet or cool stellar atmospheres. Einstein-A coefficients, which can directly be used to calculate intensities at a particular temperature, are computed for 4.3 billion (4,347,381,911) transitions between 5 million (5,160,803) energy levels. We make comparisons against other available data for \${\textasciicircum}\{12\}\$C\$\_2\$H\$\_2\$, and demonstrate this to be the most complete line list available. The line list is available in electronic form from the online CDS and ExoMol databases.},

To date, mass constraints for exoplanets are predominantly based on radial velocity (RV) measurements, which are not suited for planets with low masses, large semimajor axes, or those orbiting faint or active stars. Here, we present a method to extract an exoplanet’s mass solely from its transmission spectrum. We find good agreement between the mass retrieved for the hot Jupiter HD 189733b from transmission spectroscopy with that from RV measurements. Our method will be able to retrieve the masses of Earth-sized and super-Earth planets using data from future space telescopes that were initially designed for atmospheric characterization.},

The line intensity and position calculations were carried out using a newly determined piece-wise dipole moment function (DMF) in conjunction with the wavefunctions calculated from an experimentally determined potential energy function from Coxon \& Hajigeorgiou. A direct-fit method that simultaneously fits all the reliable experimental rovibrational matrix elements has been used to construct the dipole moment function near equilibrium internuclear distance. In order to extend the amount and quality of input experimental parameters, new Cavity Ring Down Spectroscopy experiments were carried out to enable measurements of the lines in the 4–0 band with low uncertainty as well as the first measurements of lines in the 6–0 band. A new high-level ab initio DMF, derived from a finite field approach has been calculated to cover internuclear distances far from equilibrium. Accurate partition sums have been derived for temperatures up to 9000 K. In addition to air- and self-induced broadening and shift parameters, those induced by CO2 and H2 are now provided for planetary applications. A complete set of broadening and shift parameters was calculated based on sophisticated extrapolation of high-quality measured data. The line lists, which follow HITRAN formalism, are provided as supplementary material.},

	abstract = {An isotopic-independent, highly accurate potential energy surface (PES) has been determined for CO(2) by refining a purely ab initio PES with selected, purely experimentally determined rovibrational energy levels. The purely ab initio PES is denoted Ames-0, while the refined PES is denoted Ames-1. Detailed tests are performed to demonstrate the spectroscopic accuracy of the Ames-1 PES. It is shown that Ames-1 yields σ(rms) (root-mean-squares error) = 0.0156 cm(-1) for 6873 J = 0-117 (12)C(16)O(2) experimental energy levels, even though less than 500 (12)C(16)O(2) energy levels were included in the refinement procedure. It is also demonstrated that, without any additional refinement, Ames-1 yields very good agreement for isotopologues. Specifically, for the (12)C(16)O(2) and (13)C(16)O(2) isotopologues, spectroscopic constants G(v) computed from Ames-1 are within ±0.01 and 0.02 cm(-1) of reliable experimentally derived values, while for the (16)O(12)C(18)O, (16)O(12)C(17)O, (16)O(13)C(18)O, (16)O(13)C(17)O, (12)C(18)O(2), (17)O(12)C(18)O, (12)C(17)O(2), (13)C(18)O(2), (13)C(17)O(2), (17)O(13)C(18)O, and (14)C(16)O(2) isotopologues, the differences are between ±0.10 and 0.15 cm(-1). To our knowledge, this is the first time a polyatomic PES has been refined using such high J values, and this has led to new challenges in the refinement procedure. An initial high quality, purely ab initio dipole moment surface (DMS) is constructed and used to generate a 296 K line list. For most bands, experimental IR intensities are well reproduced for (12)C(16)O(2) using Ames-1 and the DMS. For more than 80\% of the bands, the experimental intensities are reproduced with σ(rms)(ΔI) {\textless} 20\% or σ(rms)(ΔI∕δ(obs)) {\textless} 5. A few exceptions are analyzed and discussed. Directions for future improvements are discussed, though it is concluded that the current Ames-1 and the DMS should be useful in analyzing and assigning high-resolution laboratory or astronomical spectra.},

To create this compilation, ab initio line lists of 12CH4 from Rey et al. ApJ, 847, 105 (provided at separate temperatures in the TheoReTS information system), are now combined with HITRAN2016 methane data to produce a single line list suitable for high-temperature line-by-line calculations up to 2000 K. An effective-temperature interpolation model was created in order to represent continuum-like features over the temperature range of study. This model is advantageous to previously used approaches that employ so-called “super-lines,” which are suitable only at a given temperature and require separate line lists for different temperatures. The resultant HITEMP line list contains ∼32 million lines and is significantly more flexible than alternative line lists of methane, while accuracy required for astrophysical or combustion applications is retained. Comparisons against experimental observations of methane absorption at high temperatures have been used to demonstrate the accuracy of the new work. The line list includes both strong lines and quasi-continuum features and is provided in the common user-friendly HITRAN/HITEMP format, making it the most practical methane line list for radiative-transfer modeling at high-temperature conditions.},
