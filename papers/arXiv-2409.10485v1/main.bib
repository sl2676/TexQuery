	abstract = {We propose a planet formation scenario to explain the elevated occurrence rates of transiting planets around M dwarfs compared to Sun-like stars discovered by Kepler. We use a pebble drift and accretion model to simulate the growth of planet cores inside and outside of the snow line. A smaller pebble size interior to the snow line delays the growth of super-Earths, allowing giant planet cores in the outer disk to form first. When those giant planets reach pebble isolation mass they cut off the flow of pebbles to the inner disk and prevent the formation of close-in super-Earths. We apply this model to stars with masses between 0.1 and 2 M ⊙ and for a range of initial disk masses. We find that the masses of hot super-Earths and of cold giant planets are anticorrelated. The fraction of our simulations that form hot super-Earths is higher around lower-mass stars and matches the exoplanet occurrence rates from Kepler. The fraction of simulations forming cold giant planets is consistent with the stellar mass dependence from radial-velocity surveys. A key testable prediction of the pebble accretion hypothesis is that the occurrence rates of super-Earths should decrease again for M dwarfs near the substellar boundary like Trappist-1.},

	abstract = {The Kepler mission results indicate that systems of tightly packed inner planets (STIPs) are present around of order 5\% of FGK field stars (whose median age is ∼5 Gyr). We propose that STIPs initially surrounded nearly all such stars, and those observed are the final survivors of a process in which long-term metastability eventually ceases and the systems proceed to collisional consolidation or destruction, losing roughly equal fractions of systems every decade in time. In this context, we also propose that our solar system initially contained additional large planets interior to the current orbit of Venus, which survived in a metastable dynamical configuration for 1\%-10\% of the solar system’s age. Long-term gravitational perturbations caused the system orbits to cross, leading to a cataclysmic event that left Mercury as the sole surviving relic.},

	abstract = {Binary stars are ubiquitous; the majority of solar-type stars exist in binaries. Exoplanet occurrence rate is suppressed in binaries, but some multiples do still host planets. Binaries cause observational biases in planet parameters, with undetected multiplicity causing transiting planets to appear smaller than they truly are. We have analyzed the properties of a sample of 119 planet-host binary stars from the Kepler mission to study the underlying population of planets in binaries that fall in and around the radius valley, which is a demographic feature in period–radius space that marks the transition from predominantly rocky to predominantly gaseous planets. We found no statistically significant evidence for a radius gap for our sample of 122 planets in binaries when assuming that the primary stars are the planet hosts, with a low probability (p {\textless} 0.05) of the binary planet sample radius distribution being consistent with the single-star population of small planets via an Anderson–Darling test. These results reveal demographic differences in the planet size distribution between planets in binary and single stars for the first time, showing that stellar multiplicity may fundamentally alter the planet formation process. A larger sample and further assessment of circumprimary versus circumsecondary transits is needed to either validate this nondetection or explore other scenarios, such as a radius gap with a location that is dependent on binary separation.},

A stellar locus outlier method is used in this work, which works well for binaries of various periods and inclination angles with single-epoch data. With a well-selected, distance-limited sample of about 90,000 GK dwarfs covering wide stellar chemical abundances, it enables us to explore the binary fraction variations with different stellar populations. The average binary fraction is 0.42 ± 0.01 for the whole sample. Thin-disk stars are found to have a binary fraction of 0.39 ± 0.02, thick-disk stars have a higher one of 0.49 ± 0.02, while inner halo stars possibly have the highest binary fraction. For both the thin- and thick-disk stars, the binary fractions decrease toward higher [Fe/H], [α/H], and [M/H] abundances. However, the suppressing impacts of [Fe/H], [α/H], and [M/H] are more significant for the thin-disk stars than those for the thick-disk stars. For a given [Fe/H], a positive correlation between [α/Fe] and the binary fraction is found for the thin-disk stars. However, this tendency disappears for the thick-disk stars. We suspect that it is likely related to the different formation histories of the thin and thick disks. Our results provide new clues for theoretical works on binary formation.},

The formation of giant planets around low-mass stars is predicted to be rare by the core-accretion planet formation theory.

Our candidates present an exciting opportunity to improve our knowledge of the giant planet population around the lowest mass stars. We perform planet injection-recovery simulations and find that our pipeline has a high detection efficiency across the majority of our targeted parameter space. We measure the occurrence rates of giant planets with host stars in different stellar mass ranges spanning our full sample. We find occurrence rates of 0.137 ± 0.097 per cent (0.088-0.26 M⊙), 0.108 ± 0.083 per cent (0.26-0.42 M⊙), and 0.29 ± 0.15 per cent (0.42-0.71 M⊙).

Here, we build a simple framework that combines the theory of pebble accretion with the measurements of dust masses in protoplanetary disks to reconcile all three observations. First, we show that cooler stars are more efficient at converting pebbles into planetary cores at short orbital periods. Second, when disks are massive enough to nucleate a heavy core at 5 au, more than enough dust can drift in to assemble inner planets, establishing the correlation between inner planets and outer giants. Finally, while stars of varying masses are similarly capable of converting pebbles into cores at long orbital periods, hotter stars are much more likely to harbor more massive dust disks so that the giant planet occurrence rate rises around hotter stars. Our results are valid over a wide range of parameter space for a disk accretion rate that follows . We predict a decline in mini-Neptune population (but not necessarily terrestrial planets) around stars lighter than ∼0.3–0.5M ⊙. Cold giants (≳5 au), if they exist, should remain correlated with inner planets even around lower-mass stars.},

	abstract = {While it is well-established that giant-planet occurrence rises rapidly with host star metallicity, it is not yet clear if small-planet occurrence around late-type dwarf stars depends on host star metallicity. Using the Kepler Data Release 25 planet candidate list and its completeness data products, we explore planet occurrence as a function of metallicity in the Kepler field’s late-type dwarf stellar population. We find that planet occurrence increases with metallicity for all planet radii Rp down to at least Rp ≈ 2 R⊕, and that in the range 2 R⊕ ≲ Rp ≲ 5 R⊕, planet occurrence scales linearly with metallicity Z. Extrapolating our results, we predict that short-period planets with Rp ≲ 2 R⊕ should be rare around early-M dwarf stars with [M/H] ≲ −0.5 or late-M dwarf stars with [M/H] ≲ +0.0. This dependence of planet occurrence on metallicity observed in the Kepler field emphasizes the need to control for metallicity in estimates of planet occurrence for late-type dwarf stars like those targeted by Kepler’s K2 extension and the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite. We confirm the theoretical expectation that the small-planet occurrence–host star metallicity relation is stronger for low-mass stars than for solar-type stars. We establish that the expected solid mass in planets around late-type dwarfs in the Kepler field is comparable to the total amount of planet-making solids in their protoplanetary disks. We argue that this high efficiency of planet formation favors planetesimal accretion over pebble accretion as the origin of the small planets observed by Kepler around late-type dwarf stars.},

	abstract = {Context. Previous works focused on exoplanets discovered with the radial velocity (RV) method reported an anti-correlation between the orbital eccentricities of the exoplanets and the multiplicity M (I.e., the number of planets) of the systems they inhabit. Aims: We further investigate this reported anti-correlation here using a dataset comprising exoplanets discovered with both the RV and transit methods, searching for hints of its causes by exploring the connection between the number of planets and the dynamical state of the exosystems. Methods: In order to examine the correlation between multiplicity and orbital eccentricity, for every multiplicity case considered (2 ≤ M ≤ 6), we computed the weighted average eccentricities instead of the median eccentricities used previously. The average eccentricities were calculated using the inverse of the uncertainty on the eccentricity values as weights. The analysis of the dynamic state of the exosystems was performed by computing their angular momentum deficit (AMD), which is a diagnostic parameter successfully used in the study of the solar system and recently applied to exosystems as well. Results: Our results confirm the reported multiplicity-eccentricity anti-correlation and show that the use of the uncertainties on the orbital eccentricities in the analysis allows for a better agreement between the data and the fits. Specifically, our best fit reproduces well the behaviour of the average eccentricities for all systems with M{\textgreater} 1, including the additional cases of TRAPPIST-1 (M = 7) and of the solar system (M = 8). The AMD analysis, while not conclusive due to the limited number of exosystems that could be analysed, also suggests the existence of an anti-correlation between the multiplicity and the AMD of exosystems. This second anti-correlation, if confirmed by future studies, raises the possibility that the population of low-multiplicity exosystems is contaminated by former high-multiplicity systems that became dynamically unstable and lost some of their planets.},

	abstract = {The diversity of dynamical conditions among exoplanets is now well established. Yet, the relevance of orbital dynamical timescales to biological evolutionary timescales is poorly understood. Given that even minor orbital changes may place significant pressure on any organisms living on a planet, dynamical sculpting has important implications for the putative evolution of life. In this manuscript, we employ a Monte Carlo framework to investigate how a range of exoplanetary dynamical sculpting timescales affects timescales for biological evolution. We proceed with minimal assumptions for how dynamical sculpting proceeds and the emergence and persistence of life. We focus our investigation on M dwarf stars, the most common exoplanetary hosts in the Milky Way. We assign dynamical statuses, dependent on stellar age, to a suite of planetary systems, varying the rate of dynamical disruption within limits that are consistent with present-day planet demographics. We then simulate the observed yield of planets according to the completeness of NASA's Kepler and TESS missions, and investigate the properties of these samples. With this simplified approach, we find that systems hosting multiple transiting planets ought to have, on average, shorter dynamically uninterrupted intervals than single-transiting systems. However, depending upon the rate of dynamical sculpting, planets orbiting older stars will exhibit the opposite trend. Even modest constraints on stellar age would help identify older stars for which this holds. The degree of these effects varies, dependent upon both the intrinsic dynamical demographics of exoplanets and whether we consider planets detected by NASA’s Kepler or TESS missions.},

	abstract = {For temperate exoplanets orbiting M dwarf hosts, the proximity of the habitable zone to the star necessitates careful consideration of tidal effects. Spin synchronization of the planetary orbital period and rotation period is a common assumption for habitable zone planets across the entire M spectral type. This predicted tidal locking has important implications for conditions on the surface. In this manuscript, we investigate the plausibility of capture into Cassini State 2 for a known sample of 280 multiplanet systems orbiting M dwarf hosts. This resonance of the spin precession and orbital precession frequencies is capable of exciting planets into stable nonzero rotational obliquities. A large axial tilt resulting from this predicted resonance capture can preclude synchronous rotation, inducing some version of "day" and "night." Considering each planetary pair and estimating the spin and orbital precession frequencies, we report that 75\% of detected planets orbiting M dwarfs may be plausibly excited to a high obliquity over long timescales. This is consistent with similar findings for planets orbiting close-in to FGK dwarfs. However, it is only for M dwarf planets that the parameter space relevant for capture into Cassini State 2 overlaps with the stellar habitable zone. This effect is strongest for host stars with effective temperatures \$T\_\{eff\}{\textless}3000\$ K, where more than half of planets with \$T\_\{eq\}{\textless}400\$ K could possess non-zero obliquity due to residence in Cassini State 2. This overlap renders the potential capture into Cassini States extremely relevant to understanding the galaxy's most common temperate planets.},

At a demographic level, campaigns with both high-resolution imaging and radial velocity observations indicate that planet formation is strongly disrupted by close binaries, while being relatively unaffected by wide companions. However, the magnitude and distance-limited nature of those tools mean that large ranges of mass ratios and separations remain largely unexplored. The Early Data Release 3 (EDR3) from the Gaia Mission includes radial velocity measurements of over 6.5 million targets, which we employ to explore the effect of binary companions within a statistical framework called paired. These companions present as a source of excess radial velocity noise in the Gaia catalog, when compared to the typical noise for stars of similar spectral type and magnitude. Within this framework, we examine the evidence for stellar multiplicity among the stars surveyed by NASA's Kepler and TESS missions. We use radial velocity errors published in Gaia EDR3 to estimate the probability of an unresolved stellar companion for a large subset of the Kepler and TESS Input Catalog stars, where possible benchmarking our inferred radial velocity semi-amplitudes against the those from ground-based radial velocity surveys. We determine that we are typically sensitive out to several AU and mass ratios \${\textgreater}0.1\$, dependent upon the stellar magnitude. We aim for paired to be a useful community tool for the exploration of the effects of binarity on planets at a population level, and for efficient identification of false-positive transit candidates.},

	abstract = {Super-Earths - planets with sizes between the Earth and Neptune - are found in tighter orbits than that of the Earth around more than one third of main sequence stars. It has been proposed that super-Earths are scaled-up terrestrial planets that also formed similarly, through mutual accretion of planetary embryos, but in discs much denser than the solar protoplanetary disc. We argue instead that terrestrial planets and super-Earths have two clearly distinct formation pathways that are regulated by the pebble reservoir of the disc. Through numerical integrations, which combine pebble accretion and N-body gravity between embryos, we show that a difference of a factor of two in the pebble mass flux is enough to change the evolution from the terrestrial to the super-Earth growth mode. If the pebble mass flux is small, then the initial embryos within the ice line grow slowly and do not migrate substantially, resulting in a widely spaced population of approximately Mars-mass embryos when the gas disc dissipates. Subsequently, without gas being present, the embryos become unstable due to mutual gravitational interactions and a small number of terrestrial planets are formed by mutual collisions. The final terrestrial planets are at most five Earth masses. Instead, if the pebble mass flux is high, then the initial embryos within the ice line rapidly become sufficiently massive to migrate through the gas disc. Embryos concentrate at the inner edge of the disc and growth accelerates through mutual merging. This leads to the formation of a system of closely spaced super-Earths in the five to twenty Earth-mass range, bounded by the pebble isolation mass. Generally, instabilities of these super-Earth systems after the disappearance of the gas disc trigger additional merging events and dislodge the system from resonant chains. Therefore, the key difference between the two growth modes is whether embryos grow fast enough to undergo significant migration. The terrestrial growth mode produces small rocky planets on wider orbits like those in the solar system whereas the super-Earth growth mode produces planets in short-period orbits inside 1 AU, with masses larger than the Earth that should be surrounded by a primordial H/He atmosphere, unless subsequently lost by stellar irradiation. The pebble flux - which controls the transition between the two growth modes - may be regulated by the initial reservoir of solids in the disc or the presence of more distant giant planets that can halt the radial flow of pebbles.},

	abstract = {Giant planets migrate though the protoplanetary disc as they grow their solid core and attract their gaseous envelope. Previously, we have studied the growth and migration of an isolated planet in an evolving disc. Here, we generalise such models to include the mutual gravitational interaction between a high number of growing planetary bodies. We have investigated how the formation of planetary systems depends on the radial flux of pebbles through the protoplanetary disc and on the planet migration rate. Our N-body simulations confirm previous findings that Jupiter-like planets in orbits outside the water ice line originate from embryos starting out at 20-40 AU when using nominal type-I and type-II migration rates and a pebble flux of approximately 100-200 Earth masses per million years, enough to grow Jupiter within the lifetime of the solar nebula. The planetary embryos placed up to 30 AU migrate into the inner system (rP {\textless} 1AU). There they form super-Earths or hot and warm gas giants, producing systems that are inconsistent with the configuration of the solar system, but consistent with some exoplanetary systems. We also explored slower migration rates which allow the formation of gas giants from embryos originating from the 5-10 AU region, which are stranded exterior to 1 AU at the end of the gas-disc phase. These giant planets can also form in discs with lower pebbles fluxes (50-100 Earth masses per Myr). We identify a pebble flux threshold below which migration dominates and moves the planetary core to the inner disc, where the pebble isolation mass is too low for the planet to accrete gas efficiently. In our model, giant planet growth requires a sufficiently high pebble flux to enable growth to out-compete migration. An even higher pebble flux produces systems with multiple gas giants. We show that planetary embryos starting interior to 5 AU do not grow into gas giants, even if migration is slow and the pebble flux is large. These embryos instead grow to just a few Earth masses, the mass regime of super-Earths. This stunted growth is caused by the low pebble isolation mass in the inner disc and is therefore independent of the pebble flux. Additionally, we show that the long-term evolution of our formed planetary systems can naturally produce systems with inner super-Earths and outer gas giants as well as systems of giant planets on very eccentric orbits.},

We compared the stellar and planetary properties of the multis and singles in a homogeneous subset of the full CKS-Gaia catalog. We found that sub-Neptune-sized singles and multis do not differ in their stellar properties or planet radii. In particular: (1.) The distributions of stellar properties \{M\}{\textbackslash}star , [Fe/H], and v{\textbackslash}sin i for the Kepler sub-Neptune-sized singles and multis are statistically indistinguishable. (2.) The radius distributions of the sub-Neptune-sized singles and multis with P {\textgreater} 3 days are indistinguishable, and both have a valley at ∼1.8 \{R\}{\textbackslash}oplus . However, there are significantly more detected short-period (P {\textless} 3 days), sub-Neptune-sized singles than multis. The similarity of the host-star properties, planet radii, and radius valley for singles and multis suggests a common origin. The similar radius valley, which is likely sculpted by photo-evaporation from the host star within the first 100 Myr, suggests that planets in both singles and multis spend much of the first 100 Myr near their present, close-in locations. One explanation that is consistent with the similar fundamental properties of singles and multis is that many of the singles are members of multi-planet systems that underwent planet-planet scattering.

	abstract = {NASA’s Kepler mission has discovered thousands of planetary systems, ∼20\% of which are found to host multiple transiting planets. This relative paucity (compared to the high fraction of single transiting systems) is postulated to result from a distinction in the architecture between multi-transiting systems and those hosting a single transiting planet: a phenomenon usually referred to as the Kepler dichotomy. In this paper, we investigate the hypothesis that external giant planets are the main cause behind the over-abundance of single- relative to multi-transiting systems, which would be signaled by higher metallicities in the former sample. To this end, we perform a statistical analysis on the stellar metallicity distribution with respect to planet multiplicity in the Kepler data. We perform our analysis on a variety of samples taken from a population of 1166 Kepler main-sequence planetary hosts, using precisely determined metallicities from the California-Kepler survey and Swift et al. Contrary to some predictions, we do not find a significant difference between the stellar metallicities of the single- and multiple-transiting planet systems. However, we do find a 55\% upper bound for systems with a single non-giant planet that could also host a hidden giant planet, based on metallicity considerations. While the presence of external giant planets might be one factor behind the Kepler dichotomy, our results also favor alternative explanations. We suggest that additional radial velocity and direct imaging measurements are necessary to constrain the presence of gas giants in systems with a single transiting planet.},

Past work exploring this link has suggested a tentative positive correlation between these two populations, but these studies have been limited by small sample sizes and in some cases sample biases. Here we take a new look at this connection with a sample of 184 super-Earth systems with publicly available radial velocity data and resolved outer gas giants. We calculate the frequency of outer gas giants (GG) in super-Earth (SE) systems, dividing our sample into metal-rich ([Fe/H] {\textgreater} 0) and metal-poor ([Fe/H]≤0) hosts. We find P(GG∣SE, [Fe/H]{\textgreater}0) = 28.0‑4.6+4.9\% and P(GG∣SE, [Fe/H]≤0) = 4.5‑1.9+2.6\% . Comparing these conditional occurrence rates to field giant occurrence rates from Rosenthal et al. (2021), we show that there is a distinct positive correlation between inner super-Earths and outer gas giants for metal-rich host stars at the 2.7σ level, but this correlation disappears for metal-poor systems. We further find that, around metal-rich stars, the GG/SE correlation enhances slightly for systems with giants that are more distant (beyond 3 au), more eccentric (e {\textgreater} 0.2), and/or in multi-gas giant systems. Such trends disappear around metal-poor stars with the exception of systems of multiple giants in which we observe a tentative anti-correlation. Our findings highlight the critical role metallicity (disk solid budget) plays in shaping the overall planetary architecture.},

We consistently refit published RV data sets for 65 stars and find nine systems with statistically significant trends indicating the presence of an outer companion. We combine these RV data with AO images to constrain the masses and semi-major axes of these companions. We quantify our sensitivity to the presence of long-period companions by fitting the sample with a power-law distribution and find an occurrence rate of 39\% ± 7\% for companions 0.5-20 M Jup and 1-20 au. Half of our systems were discovered by the transit method, and half were discovered by the RV method. While differences in the RV baselines and number of data points between the two samples lead to different sensitivities to distant companions, we find that occurrence rates of gas giant companions in each sample are consistent at the 0.5σ level. We compare the frequency of Jupiter analogs in these systems to the equivalent rate from field star surveys and find that Jupiter analogs are more common around stars hosting super-Earths. We conclude that the presence of outer gas giants does not suppress the formation of inner super-Earths, and that these two populations of planets instead appear to be correlated. We also find that the stellar metallicities of systems with gas giant companions are higher than those without companions, in agreement with the well-established metallicity correlation from RV surveys of field stars.},

We find that cold Jupiters appear three times more often around hosts of super Earths than they do around field stars. Given the prevalence of the super Earth systems, their cold Jupiters can account for nearly all cold Jupiters. In other words, cold Jupiters are almost certainly (∼90\%) accompanied by super Earths. A few corollaries follow: (1) around metal-rich ([Fe/H] {\textgreater} 0.1) stars, the fraction of super Earths with cold Jupiters can rise to 60\% or higher; (2) the inner architecture can be strongly impacted by the outer giant and we report some observational evidence for this; (3) planetary systems like our own, with cold Jupiters but no super Earths, should be rare (∼1\%). The strong correlation between super Earths and cold Jupiters establish that super Earths and cold Jupiters do not compete for solid material, rather, they share similar origins, with the cold Jupiter formation requiring a somewhat more stringent condition. Lastly, we propose a few immediate observational tests of our results, using ground-based RV observations and ongoing/planned space missions.},

These planets—or their building blocks—may have formed on wider orbits and migrated inward due to interactions with the gaseous protoplanetary disk. Here, we use a suite of dynamical simulations to show that gas giant planets act as barriers to the inward migration of super-Earths initially placed on more distant orbits. Jupiter’s early formation may have prevented Uranus and Neptune (and perhaps Saturn’s core) from becoming hot super-Earths. Our model predicts that the populations of hot super-Earth systems and Jupiter-like planets should be anti-correlated: gas giants (especially if they form early) should be rare in systems with many hot super-Earths. Testing this prediction will constitute a crucial assessment of the validity of the migration hypothesis for the origin of close-in super-Earths.},

However, these planets are missing in our Solar System and the reason behind this absence is still unknown. Two theoretical scenarios invoke the role of Jupiter as the possible culprit: Jupiter may have acted as a dynamical barrier to the inward migration of sub-Neptunes from beyond the water iceline; alternatively, Jupiter may have considerably reduced the inward flux of material (pebbles) required to form super-Earths inside that iceline. Both scenarios predict an anti-correlation between the presence of small planets and that of cold Jupiters in exoplanetary systems. To test that prediction, we homogeneously analyzed the radial-velocity measurements of 38 Kepler and K2 transiting small planet systems gathered over nearly ten years with the HARPS-N spectrograph, as well as publicly available radial velocities collected with other facilities. We used Bayesian differential evolution Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques, which in some cases were coupled with Gaussian process regression to model non-stationary variations due to stellar magnetic activity phenomena. We detected five cold Jupiters in three systems: two in Kepler-68, two in Kepler-454, and a very eccentric one in K2-312. We also found linear trends caused by bound companions in Kepler-93, Kepler-454, and K2-12, with slopes that are still compatible with a planetary mass for outer bodies in the Kepler-454 and K2-12 systems. By using binomial statistics and accounting for the survey completeness, we derived an occurrence rate of 9.3−2.9+7.7\% for cold Jupiters with 0.3-13 MJup and 1-10 AU, which is lower but still compatible at 1.3σ with the value measured from radial-velocity surveys for solar-type stars, regardless of the presence or absence of small planets. The sample is not large enough to draw a firm conclusion about the predicted anti-correlation between small planets and cold Jupiters; nevertheless, we found no evidence of previous claims of an excess of cold Jupiters in small planet systems. As an important byproduct of our analyses, we homogeneously determined the masses of 64 Kepler and K2 small planets, reaching a precision better than 5, 7.5, and 10σ for 25, 13, and 8 planets, respectively. Finally, we release the 3661 HARPS-N radial velocities used in this work to the scientific community. These radial-velocity measurements mainly benefit from an improved data reduction software that corrects for subtle prior systematic effects.

	abstract = {Compact multiplanet systems containing super-Earths or sub-Neptunes, commonly found around solar-type stars, may be surrounded by external giant planet or stellar companions, which can shape the architecture and observability of the inner systems. We present a comprehensive study on the evolution of the inner planetary system subject to the gravitational influence of an eccentric, misaligned outer perturber. Analytic results are derived for the inner planet eccentricities (ei) and mutual inclination (θ12) of the `two-planet + perturber' system, calibrated with numerical secular and N-body integrations, as a function of the perturber mass mp, semimajor axis ap, and inclination angle θp. We find that the dynamics of the inner system is determined by the dimensionless parameter ɛ12, given by the ratio between the differential precession rate driven by the perturber and the mutual precession rate of the inner planets. Loosely packed systems (corresponding to ɛ12 ≫ 1) are more susceptible to eccentricity/inclination excitations by the perturber than tightly packed inner systems (with ɛ12 ≪ 1) (or singletons), although resonance may occur around ɛ12 ∼ 1, leading to large ei and θ12. Dynamical instability may set in for inner planet systems with large excited eccentricities and mutual inclinations. We present a formalism to extend our analytical results to general inner systems with N {\textgreater} 2 planets and apply our results to constrain possible external companions to the Kepler-11 system. Eccentricity and inclination excitation by external companions may help explain the observational trend that systems with fewer transiting planets are dynamically hotter than those with more transiting planets.},

	abstract = {The Kepler mission has detected thousands of planetary systems with one to seven transiting planets packed within 0.7 au from their host stars. There is an apparent excess of single-transit planet systems that cannot be explained by transit geometries alone, when a single planetary mutual inclination dispersion is assumed. This suggests that the observed compact planetary systems have at least two different architectures. We present a scenario where the “Kepler dichotomy” may be explained by the action of an external giant planet or stellar companion misaligned with the inner multi-planet system. The external companion excites mutual inclinations of the inner planets, causing such systems to appear as “Kepler singles” in transit surveys. We derive approximate analytic expressions (in various limiting regimes), calibrated with numerical calculations, for the mutual inclination excitations for various planetary systems and perturber properties (mass mp, semimajor axis ap, and inclination \{θ \}p). In general, the excited mutual inclination increases with \{m\}p/\{a\}p3 and \{θ \}p, though secular resonances may lead to large mutual inclinations even for small \{θ \}p. We discuss the implications of our results for understanding the dynamical history of transiting planet systems with known external perturbers.},

	abstract = {The hundreds of multiple planetary systems discovered by the Kepler mission are typically observed to reside in close-in (≲ 0.5 AU), low-eccentricity, low-inclination orbits. We run N-body experiments to study the effect that unstable outer (≳ 1 AU) giant planets, whose end orbital configurations resemble those in the Radial Velocity population, have on these close-in multiple super-Earth systems. Our experiments show that the giant planets greatly reduce the multiplicity of the inner super-Earths, and the surviving population can have large eccentricities (e≳ 0.3) and inclinations (I≳ 20{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ ) at levels that anti-correlate with multiplicity. Consequently, this model predicts the existence of a population of dynamically hot single-transiting planets with typical eccentricities and inclinations of ∼0.1-0.5 and ∼10°-40°. We show that these results can explain the following observations: (I) the recent eccentricity measurements of Kepler super-Earths from transit durations; (II) the tentative observation that single-transiting systems have a wider distribution of stellar obliquity angles compared to the multiple-transiting systems; (III) the architecture of some eccentric super-Earths discovered by Radial Velocity surveys such as HD 125612c. Future observations from TESS will reveal many more dynamically hot single transiting planets, for which follow up radial velocity studies will be able to test our models and see whether they have outer giant planets.},

	abstract = {The orbital distributions of currently observed extrasolar giant planets allow marginally stable orbits for hypothetical, terrestrial planets. In this paper, we propose that many of these systems may not have additional planets on these "stable" orbits, since past dynamical instability among giant planets could have removed them. We numerically investigate the effects of early evolution of multiple giant planets on the orbital stability of the inner, sub-Neptune-like planets which are modeled as test particles, and determine their dynamically unstable region. Previous studies have shown that the majority of such test particles are ejected out of the system as a result of close encounters with giant planets. Here, we show that secular perturbations from giant planets can remove test particles at least down to 10 times smaller than their minimum pericenter distance. Our results indicate that, unless the dynamical instability among giant planets is either absent or quiet like planet-planet collisions, most test particles down to {\textasciitilde}0.1 AU within the orbits of giant planets at a few AU may be gone. In fact, out of {\textasciitilde}30\% of survived test particles, about three quarters belong to the planet-planet collision cases. We find a good agreement between our numerical results and the secular theory, and present a semi-analytical formula which estimates the dynamically unstable region of the test particles just from the evolution of giant planets. Finally, our numerical results agree well with the observations, and also predict the existence of hot rocky planets in eccentric giant planet systems.},

A stellar locus outlier method is used in this work, which works well for binaries of various periods and inclination angles with single-epoch data. With a well-selected, distance-limited sample of about 90,000 GK dwarfs covering wide stellar chemical abundances, it enables us to explore the binary fraction variations with different stellar populations. The average binary fraction is 0.42 ± 0.01 for the whole sample. Thin-disk stars are found to have a binary fraction of 0.39 ± 0.02, thick-disk stars have a higher one of 0.49 ± 0.02, while inner halo stars possibly have the highest binary fraction. For both the thin- and thick-disk stars, the binary fractions decrease toward higher [Fe/H], [α/H], and [M/H] abundances. However, the suppressing impacts of [Fe/H], [α/H], and [M/H] are more significant for the thin-disk stars than those for the thick-disk stars. For a given [Fe/H], a positive correlation between [α/Fe] and the binary fraction is found for the thin-disk stars. However, this tendency disappears for the thick-disk stars. We suspect that it is likely related to the different formation histories of the thin and thick disks. Our results provide new clues for theoretical works on binary formation.},

We found that all the analysed clusters contain a minimum binary fraction larger than 11 per cent within the core radius. The estimated global fractions of binary systems range from 35 to 70 per cent depending on the cluster. The comparison with homogeneous estimates performed in globular clusters indicates that open clusters hold a significantly higher fraction of binary systems, as predicted by theoretical models and N-body simulations. A dependence of the relative fraction of binary systems on the cluster mass has been detected, suggesting that the binary disruption within the cluster core is the dominant process that drives the fraction of binaries in stellar systems.},

We explore this connection by analyzing the metallicities of Kepler target stars and the subset of stars found to host transiting planets. After correcting for survey incompleteness, we measure planet occurrence: the number of planets per 100 stars with a given metallicity M. Planet occurrence correlates with metallicity for some, but not all, planet sizes and orbital periods. For warm super-Earths having P = 10–100 days and = 1.0–1.7 , planet occurrence is nearly constant over metallicities spanning −0.4 to +0.4 dex. We find 20 warm super-Earths per 100 stars, regardless of metallicity. In contrast, the occurrence of warm sub-Neptunes ( = 1.7–4.0 ) doubles over that same metallicity interval, from 20 to 40 planets per 100 stars. We model the distribution of planets as , where β characterizes the strength of any metallicity correlation. This correlation steepens with decreasing orbital period and increasing planet size. For warm super-Earths β = , while for hot Jupiters β = . High metallicities in protoplanetary disks may increase the mass of the largest rocky cores or the speed at which they are assembled, enhancing the production of planets larger than 1.7 . The association between high metallicity and short-period planets may reflect disk density profiles that facilitate the inward migration of solids or higher rates of planet–planet scattering.},

	abstract = {One of the fundamental questions in astronomy is how planetary systems form and evolve. Measuring the planetary occurrence and architecture as a function of time directly addresses this question. In the fourth paper of the Planets Across Space and Time series, we investigate the occurrence and architecture of Kepler planetary systems as a function of kinematic age by using the LAMOST-Gaia-Kepler sample. To isolate the age effect, other stellar properties (e.g., metallicity) have been controlled. We find the following results. (1) The fraction of stars with Kepler-like planets (F Kep) is about 50\% for all stars; no significant trend is found between F Kep and age. (2) The average planet multiplicity ( \$\{{\textbackslash}bar\{N\}\}\_\{p\}\$ ) exhibits a decreasing trend ({\textasciitilde}2σ significance) with age. It decreases from \$\{{\textbackslash}bar\{N\}\}\_\{p\}\$ {\textasciitilde} 3 for stars younger than 1 Gyr to \$\{{\textbackslash}bar\{N\}\}\_\{p\}\$ {\textasciitilde} 1.8 for stars of about 8 Gyr. (3) The number of planets per star (η = F Kep× \$\{{\textbackslash}bar\{N\}\}\_\{p\}\$ ) also shows a decreasing trend ({\textasciitilde}2σ-3σ significance). It decreases from η {\textasciitilde} 1.6-1.7 for young stars to η {\textasciitilde} 1.0 for old stars. (4) The mutual orbital inclination of the planets (σ i,k ) increases from \$1{\textbackslash}buildrel\{{\textbackslash}circ\}{\textbackslash}over\{.\} \{2\}\_\{-0.5\}{\textasciicircum}\{+1.4\}\$ to \$3{\textbackslash}buildrel\{{\textbackslash}circ\}{\textbackslash}over\{.\} \{5\}\_\{-2.3\}{\textasciicircum}\{+8.1\}\$ as the stars age from 0.5 to 8 Gyr with a best fit of \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{log\}\{{\textbackslash}sigma \}\_\{i,k\}=0.2+0.4{\textbackslash}times {\textbackslash}mathrm\{log\}{\textbackslash}tfrac\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{Age\}\}\{1{\textbackslash}mathrm\{Gyr\}\}\$ . Interestingly, the solar system also fits such a trend. The fact that F Kep remains relatively constant at approximately {\textasciitilde} 50\% across different ages suggests the robustness of planet formation throughout the history of the Galaxy. The age dependence of \$\{{\textbackslash}bar\{N\}\}\_\{p\}\$ and σ i,k demonstrates that the planetary architecture is evolving, and planetary systems generally become dynamically hotter with fewer planets as they age.},

This "planet radius valley" separates compact, rocky super-Earths (Rp = 1.0-1.8 R⊕) from larger sub-Neptunes (Rp = 1.8-3.5 R⊕) hosting a gaseous hydrogen-helium envelope around their rocky core. Various hypotheses for this radius valley have been put forward, which all rely on physics internal to the planetary system: photoevaporation by the host star, long-term mass loss driven by the cooling planetary core, or the transition between two fundamentally different planet formation modes as gas is lost from the protoplanetary disk. Here we report the discovery that the planet radius distribution exhibits a strong dependence on ambient stellar clustering, characterized by measuring the position-velocity phase space density with Gaia. When dividing the planet sample into "field" and "overdensity" subsamples, we find that planetary systems in the field exhibit a statistically significant (p = 5.5 × 10-3) dearth of planets below the radius valley compared to systems in phase space overdensities. This implies that the large-scale stellar environment of a planetary system is a key factor setting the planet radius distribution. We discuss how models for the radius valley might be revised following our findings and conclude that a multiscale, multiphysics scenario is needed, connecting planet formation and evolution, star and stellar cluster formation, and galaxy evolution.},

The targets were chosen according to the basic criteria that 1) they formed part of a limited volume and 2) they did not present the signature of a planetary host companion. A few stars with planets were also observed and analysed; namely, HD 6434, HD 13445 (Gl 86), HD 16141, HD 17051 (iota Hor), HD 19994, HD 22049 (epsilon Eri), HD 28185, HD 38529, HD 52265, HD 190228, HD 210277 and HD 217107. For some of these objects there had been no previous spectroscopic studies. The spectroscopic analysis was done using the same technique as in previous work on the metallicity of stars with planets, thereby permitting a direct comparison of the results. The work described in this paper thus represents the first uniform and unbiased comparison between stars with and without planetary-mass companions in a volume-limited sample. The results show that 1) stars with planets are significantly metal-rich, and 2) that the source of the metallicity is most probably ``primordial''. The results presented here may impose serious constraints on planetary system formation and evolution models.

	abstract = {Context. Revealing the mechanisms shaping the architecture of planetary systems is crucial for our understanding of their formation and evolution. In this context, it has been recently proposed that stellar clustering might be the key in shaping the orbital architecture of exoplanets. Aims: The main goal of this work is to explore the factors that shape the orbits of planets. Methods: We performed different statistical tests to compare the properties of planets and their host stars associated with different stellar environments. Results: We used a homogeneous sample of relatively young FGK dwarf stars with radial velocity detected planets and tested the hypothesis that their association to phase space (position-velocity) over-densities ("cluster" stars) and under-densities ("field" stars) impacts the orbital periods of planets. When controlling for the host star properties on a sample of 52 planets orbiting around cluster stars and 15 planets orbiting around field stars, we found no significant difference in the period distribution of planets orbiting these two populations of stars. By considering an extended sample of 73 planets orbiting around cluster stars and 25 planets orbiting field stars, a significant difference in the planetary period distributions emerged. However, the hosts associated with stellar under-densities appeared to be significantly older than their cluster counterparts. This does not allow us to conclude as to whether the planetary architecture is related to age, environment, or both. We further studied a sample of planets orbiting cluster stars to study the mechanism responsible for the shaping of orbits of planets in similar environments. We could not identify a parameter that can unambiguously be responsible for the orbital architecture of massive planets, perhaps, indicating the complexity of the issue. Conclusions: An increased number of planets in clusters and in over-density environments will help to build large and unbiased samples which will then allow to better understand the dominant processes shaping the orbits of planets.

The former directly reveals the planet formation efficiency, whereas the latter reveals the final product of formation and evolution. We show that these two occurrence rates have different dependences on stellar metallicity. Specifically, the fraction of stars with planets rises gradually with metallicity, from ∼25\% to ∼36\% for 0.4 dex of [Fe/H] for all Kepler-like planets (period P {\textless} 400 days and radius \{R\}\{\{p\}\}≳ \{R\}{\textbackslash}oplus ). The average number of planets per star reaches a plateau (or possibly starts declining) at [Fe/H] ≳ 0.1. This is plausibly caused by the emergence of distant giant planets at high metallicities, given that the close-in small planets and the distant giants preferentially coexist in the same system.},

We present a catalogue of the chemo-kinematic properties of 2218 434 stars in the TESS Candidate Target List using survey data from Gaia DR2, APOGEE, GALAH, RAVE, LAMOST, and photometrically derived stellar properties from SkyMapper. We compute kinematic thin disc, thick disc, and halo membership probabilities for these stars and find that though the majority of TESS targets are in the thin disc, 4 per cent of them reside in the thick disc and \&lt;1 per cent of them are in the halo. The TESS Objects of Interest in our sample also display similar contributions from the thin disc, thick disc, and halo with a majority of them being in the thin disc. We also explore metallicity and [α/Fe] distributions for each Galactic component and show that each cross-matched survey exhibits metallicity and [α/Fe] distribution functions that peak from higher to lower metallicity and lower to higher [α/Fe] from the thin disc to the halo. This catalogue will be useful to explore planet occurrence rates, among other things, with respect to kinematics, component membership, metallicity, or [α/Fe].},

	abstract = {Planet formation is expected to be severely limited in disks of low metallicity, owing to both the small solid mass reservoir and the low-opacity accelerating the disk gas dissipation. While previous studies have found a weak correlation between the occurrence rates of small planets (≲4R ⊕) and stellar metallicity, so far no studies have probed below the metallicity limit beyond which planet formation is predicted to be suppressed. Here, we constructed a large catalog of ∼110,000 metal-poor stars observed by the TESS mission with spectroscopically derived metallicities, and systematically probed planet formation within the metal-poor regime ([Fe/H] ≤‑0.5) for the first time. Extrapolating known higher-metallicity trends for small, short-period planets predicts the discovery of ∼68 super-Earths around these stars (∼85,000 stars) after accounting for survey completeness; however, we detect none. As a result, we have placed the most stringent upper limit on super-Earth occurrence rates around metal-poor stars (‑0.75 {\textless} [Fe/H] ≤ ‑0.5) to date, ≤ 1.67\%, a statistically significant (p-value = 0.000685) deviation from the prediction of metallicity trends derived with Kepler and K2. We find a clear host star metallicity cliff for super-Earths that could indicate the threshold below which planets are unable to grow beyond an Earth-mass at short orbital periods. This finding provides a crucial input to planet-formation theories, and has implications for the small planet inventory of the Galaxy and the galactic epoch at which the formation of small planets started.},

	abstract = {We find that Kepler exoplanet candidate (EC) host stars are preferentially metal rich, including the low-mass stellar hosts of small-radius ECs. The last observation confirms a tentative hint that there is a correlation between the metallicity of low-mass stars and the presence of low-mass and small-radius exoplanets. In particular, we compare the J-H-g-r color-color distribution of Kepler EC host stars with a control sample of dwarf stars selected from the {\textasciitilde}150, 000 stars observed during Q1 and Q2 of the Kepler mission but with no detected planets. We find that at J - H = 0.30 characteristic of solar-type stars, the average g-r color of stars that host giant ECs is 4σ redder than the average color of the stars in the control sample. At the same J - H color, the average g-r color of solar-type stars that host small-radius ECs is indistinguishable from the average color of the stars in the control sample. In addition, we find that at J - H = 0.62 indicative of late K dwarfs, the average g-r color of stars that host small-radius ECs is 4σ redder than the average color of the stars in the control sample. These offsets are unlikely to be caused by differential reddening, age differences between the two populations, or the presence of giant stars in the control sample. Stellar models suggest that the first color offset is due to a 0.2 dex enhancement in [Fe/H] of the giant EC host population at M * ≈ 1 M sun, while Sloan photometry of M 67 and NGC 6791 suggests that the second color offset is due to a similar [Fe/H] enhancement of the small-radius EC host population at M * ≈ 0.7 M sun. These correlations are a natural consequence of the core-accretion model of planet formation.},

In this work, we use chemical cartography to explore the metallicity distribution of OBAF-type disc stars from the LAMOST survey and a complementary sample of disc giant stars from Gaia DR3. We use these samples to constrain the radial and vertical metallicity gradients across the Galactic disc. We also explore whether there are detectable azimuthal variations in the metallicity distribution on top of the radial gradient. For the OBAF-type star sample from LAMOST, we find a radial metallicity gradient of Δ[Fe/H]/ΔR {\textasciitilde}-0.078 ± 0.001 dex kpc-1 in the plane of the disc and a vertical metallicity gradient of Δ[Fe/H]/ΔZ {\textasciitilde}-0.15 ± 0.01 dex kpc-1 in the solar neighbourhood. The radial gradient becomes shallower with increasing vertical height, while the vertical gradient becomes shallower with increasing Galactocentric radius, consistent with other studies. We also find detectable spatially dependent azimuthal variations on top of the radial metallicity gradient at the level of {\textasciitilde}0.10 dex. Interestingly, the azimuthal variations appear be close to the Galactic spiral arms in one data set (Gaia DR3) but not the other (LAMOST). These results suggest that there is azimuthal structure in the Galactic metallicity distribution and that in some cases it is co-located with spiral arms.},

Our study found that the thick disk globally exhibits no metallicity radial gradient, but the inner disk (R ≤ 8 kpc) and the outer disk (R {\textgreater} 8 kpc) have different gradients when they are studied separately. The thin disk also shows two different metallicity radial gradients for the inner disk and the outer disk, and has a steep metallicity vertical gradient of dex kpc−1, which becomes flat when it is measured at increasing radial distance. The metallicity radial gradient on the other hand becomes weaker with increasing vertical distance. Adopting a Galaxy potential model, we derived the orbital eccentricity of sample stars and found a downtrend of average eccentricity with increasing metallicity for the thick disk. The variation of the rotation velocity with the metallicity shows a positive gradient for the thick disk stars and a negative one for the thin disk stars. Comparisons of our observed results with models of disk formation suggest that radial migration could have influenced the chemical evolution of the thin disk. The formation of the thick disk could be affected by more than one process: the accretion model could play an indispensable role, while other formation mechanisms, such as the radial-migration or disk-heating model could also have a contribution.},

	abstract = {Accurate measurements of stellar metallicity gradients in the radial and vertical directions of the disk and their temporal variations provide important constraints on the formation and evolution of the Milky Way disk. We use 297 042 main sequence turn-off stars selected from the LAMOST Spectroscopic Survey of the Galactic Anti-center (LSS-GAC) to determine the radial and vertical gradients of stellar metallicity, Δ[Fe/H]/ΔR and Δ[Fe/H]/Δ{\textbar}Z{\textbar} of the Milky Way disk in the direction of the anticenter. We determine ages of those turn-off stars by isochrone fitting and measure the temporal variations of metallicity gradients. We have carried out a detailed analysis of the selection effects resulting from the selection, observation and data reduction of LSS-GAC targets and the potential biases of a magnitude limited sample on the determinations of metallicity gradients. Our results show that the gradients, both in the radial and vertical directions, exhibit significant spatial and temporal variations. The radial gradients yielded by stars with the oldest ages (≳ 11 Gyr) are essentially zero at all heights from the disk midplane, while those given by younger stars are always negative. The vertical gradients deduced from stars with the oldest ages (≳ 11 Gyr) are negative and only show very weak variations with Galactocentric distance in the disk plane, R, while those yielded by younger stars show strong variations with R. After being essentially flat at the earliest epochs of disk formation, the radial gradients steepen as age decreases, reaching a maximum (steepest) at age 7–8 Gyr, and then they flatten again. Similar temporal trends are also found for the vertical gradients. We infer that the assembly of the Milky Way disk may have experienced at least two distinct phases. The earlier phase is probably related to a slow, pressure-supported collapse of gas, when the gas settles down to the disk mainly in the vertical direction. In the later phase, there are significant radial flows of gas in the disk, and the rate of gas inflow near the solar neighborhood reaches a maximum around a lookback time of 7–8 Gyr. The transition between the two phases occurs around a lookback time between 8 and 11 Gyr. The two phases may be responsible for the formation of the Milky Way's thick and thin disks, respectively. Also, as a consequence, we recommend that stellar age is a natural, physical criterion to distinguish stars from the thin and thick disks. From an epoch earlier than 11Gyr to one between 8 and 11Gyr, there is an abrupt, significant change in magnitude of both the radial and vertical metallicity gradients, suggesting that stellar radial migration is unlikely to play an important role in the formation of the thick disk.},

The results are based upon the analysis of high-resolution UVES spectra from the {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater}-ESO large stellar survey. We explore the limitations of the observed dataset, i.e. the accuracy of stellar parameters and the selection effects that are caused by the photometric target preselection. We find that the colour and magnitude cuts in the survey suppress old metal-rich stars and young metal-poor stars. This suppression may be as high as 97\% in some regions of the age-metallicity relationship. The dataset consists of 144 stars with a wide range of ages from 0.5 Gyr to 13.5 Gyr, Galactocentric distances from 6 kpcto 9.5 kpc, and vertical distances from the plane 0 {\textless} {\textbar}{\textless}i{\textgreater}Z{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textbar} {\textless} 1.5 kpc. On this basis, we find that i) the observed age-metallicity relation is nearly flat in the range of ages between 0 Gyr and 8 Gyr; ii) at ages older than 9 Gyr, we see a decrease in [Fe/H] and a clear absence of metal-rich stars; this cannot be explained by the survey selection functions; iii) there is a significant scatter of [Fe/H] at any age; and iv) [Mg/Fe] increases with age, but the dispersion of [Mg/Fe] at ages {\textgreater}9 Gyr is not as small as advocated by some other studies. In agreement with earlier work, we find that radial abundance gradients change as a function of vertical distance from the plane. The [Mg/Fe] gradient steepens and becomes negative. In addition, we show that the inner disk is not only more {\textless}i{\textgreater}α{\textless}i/{\textgreater}-rich compared to the outer disk, but also older, as traced independently by the ages and Mg abundances of stars.},

	abstract = {This paper reports on the spectroscopic investigation of 238 Cepheids in the northern sky. Of these stars, about 150 are new to the study of the galactic abundance gradient. These new Cepheids bring the total number of Cepheids involved in abundance distribution studies to over 400. In this work, we also consider systematics between various studies and also those which result from the choice of models. We find that systematic variations exist at the 0.06 dex level both between studies and model atmospheres. In order to control the systematic effects our final gradients depend only on abundances derived herein. A simple linear fit to the Cepheid data from 398 stars yields a gradient d[Fe/H]/dRG = −0.062 ± 0.002 dex kpc−1 which is in good agreement with previously determined values. We have also re-examined the region of the “metallicity island” of Luck et al. With the doubling of the sample in that region and our internally consistent abundances, we find that there is scant evidence for a distinct island. We also find in our sample the first reported Cepheid (V1033 Cyg) with a pronounced Li feature. The Li abundance is consistent with the star being on its redward pass toward the first giant branch.},

The time evolution of the metallicity distribution is characterized by a uniform increase of the metallicity at all radii, preserving the shape of the gradient, with marginal evidence for a flattening of the gradient with time in the radial range 7-12 kpc. Our model is able to reproduce the main features of the metallicity gradient and its evolution with an infall law exponentially decreasing with radius and with a collapse time scale of the order of 8 Gyr at the solar radius. This results in a rapid collapse in the inner regions, i.e. kpc (that we associate with an early phase of disk formation from the collapse of the halo) and in a slow inflow of material per unit area in the outer regions at a constant rate with time (that we associate with accretion from the intergalactic medium). An additional uniform inflow per unit disk area would help to better reproduce the metallicity plateau at large Galactocentric radii, but it is difficult to reconcile with the present-day radial behaviour of the star formation rate.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Conclusions. {\textless}i/{\textgreater}Our results favour a scenario where the Galactic disk is formed inside-out by the rapid collapse of the halo and by a subsequent continuous accretion of intergalactic gas},

Based on high-resolution spectra obtained for 19 distant Cepheids we sampled galactocentric distances from 10 to 12 kpc. Combined with the results of our previous work on the inner and middle parts of the galactic disc, the present data enable one to study the structure of the radial abundance distribution over a large baseline. In particular, we find indications of a discontinuity in the radial abundance distribution for iron as well as a number of the other elements. The discontinuity is seen at a galactocentric distance RG = 10 kpc. This finding supports the results reported earlier by Twarog et al. ({\textbackslash}cite\{twaet97\}).

The problem of the real metallicity gradient for stars having the same age and birthplace is investigated, the observed chemical gradient is compared with the temporal evolution of the mean metallicity, and the metal-content variation perpendicular to the galactic disk is estimated. It is found that the weighted mean of the chemical gradient in the Galaxy is about -0.05 per kpc; if only stars with orbits having eccentricities of 0.05 to 0.15 are considered, the gradient becomes approximately -0.10 per kpc. The difference between mean metallicity in the galactic plane and at 500 pc above or below it is estimated to be about a factor of two.},

	abstract = {The effect of stellar multiplicity on the formation and evolution of planetary systems is complex. At a demographic level, campaigns with both high-resolution imaging and radial velocity observations indicate that planet formation is strongly disrupted by close binaries, while being relatively unaffected by wide companions. However, the magnitude and distance-limited nature of those tools mean that large ranges of mass ratios and separations remain largely unexplored. The Early Data Release 3 (EDR3) from the Gaia Mission includes radial velocity measurements of over 6.5 million targets, which we employ to explore the effect of binary companions within a statistical framework called paired. These companions present as a source of excess radial velocity noise in the Gaia catalog, when compared to the typical noise for stars of similar spectral type and magnitude. Within this framework, we examine the evidence for stellar multiplicity among the stars surveyed by NASA's Kepler and TESS missions. We use radial velocity errors published in Gaia EDR3 to estimate the probability of an unresolved stellar companion for a large subset of the Kepler and TESS Input Catalog stars, where possible benchmarking our inferred radial velocity semi-amplitudes against the those from ground-based radial velocity surveys. We determine that we are typically sensitive out to several AU and mass ratios \${\textgreater}0.1\$, dependent upon the stellar magnitude. We aim for paired to be a useful community tool for the exploration of the effects of binarity on planets at a population level, and for efficient identification of false-positive transit candidates.},

	abstract = {THE recent discoveries1–4 of massive planetary companions orbiting several solar-type stars pose a conundrum. Conventional models5,6 for the formation of giant planets (such as Jupiter and Saturn) place such objects at distances of several astronomical units from the parent star, whereas all but one of the new objects are on orbits well inside 1 AU; these planets must therefore have originated at larger distances and subsequently migrated inwards. One suggested migration mechanism invokes tidal interactions between the planet and the evolving circumstellar disk7. Such a mechanism results in planets with small, essentially circular orbits, which appears to be the case for many of the new planets. But two of the objects have substantial orbital eccentricities, which are difficult to reconcile with a tidal-linkage model. Here we describe an alternative model for planetary migration that can account for these large orbital eccentricities. If a system of three or more giant planets form about a star, their orbits may become unstable as they gain mass by accreting gas from the circumstellar disk; subsequent gravitational encounters among these planets can eject one from the system while placing the others into highly eccentric orbits both closer and farther from the star.},

We study how it might arrive at such an orbit and how it has avoided being tidally circularized until now. The presence of a stellar companion to the host star suggests the possibility that the Kozai mechanism and tidal dissipation combined to draw the planet inward well after it formed: Kozai oscillations produce periods of extreme eccentricity in the planet orbit, and the tidal dissipation that occurs during these periods of small pericenter distances leads to gradual orbital decay. We call this migration mechanism the "Kozai migration." It requires that the initial planet orbit be highly inclined relative to the binary orbit. For a companion at 1000 AU and an initial planet orbit at 5 AU, the minimum relative inclination required is 85°. We discuss the efficiency of tidal dissipation inferred from the observations of exoplanets. Moreover, we investigate possible explanations for the velocity residual (after the motion induced by the planet is removed) observed on the host star: a second planet in the system is excluded over a large extent of semimajor axis space if Kozai migration is to work, and the tide raised on the star by HD 80606b is likely too small in amplitude. Last, we discuss the relevance of Kozai migration for other planetary systems.},

	abstract = {At least two arguments suggest that the orbits of a large fraction of binary stars and extrasolar planets shrank by 1-2 orders of magnitude after formation: (1) the physical radius of a star shrinks by a large factor from birth to the main sequence, yet many main-sequence stars have companions orbiting only a few stellar radii away, and (2) in current theories of planet formation, the region within {\textasciitilde}0.1 AU of a protostar is too hot and rarefied for a Jupiter-mass planet to form, yet many ``hot Jupiters'' are observed at such distances. We investigate orbital shrinkage by the combined effects of secular perturbations from a distant companion star (Kozai oscillations) and tidal friction. We integrate the relevant equations of motion to predict the distribution of orbital elements produced by this process. Binary stars with orbital periods of 0.1-10 days, with a median of {\textasciitilde}2 days, are produced from binaries with much longer periods (10 to {\textasciitilde}105 days), consistent with observations indicating that most or all short-period binaries have distant companions (tertiaries). We also make two new testable predictions: (1) For periods between 3 and 10 days, the distribution of the mutual inclination between the inner binary and the tertiary orbit should peak strongly near 40° and 140°. (2) Extrasolar planets whose host stars have a distant binary companion may also undergo this process, in which case the orbit of the resulting hot Jupiter will typically be misaligned with the equator of its host star.

	abstract = {At least two arguments suggest that the orbits of a large fraction of binary stars and extrasolar planets shrank by 1-2 orders of magnitude after formation: (1) the physical radius of a star shrinks by a large factor from birth to the main sequence, yet many main-sequence stars have companions orbiting only a few stellar radii away, and (2) in current theories of planet formation, the region within {\textasciitilde}0.1 AU of a protostar is too hot and rarefied for a Jupiter-mass planet to form, yet many ``hot Jupiters'' are observed at such distances. We investigate orbital shrinkage by the combined effects of secular perturbations from a distant companion star (Kozai oscillations) and tidal friction. We integrate the relevant equations of motion to predict the distribution of orbital elements produced by this process. Binary stars with orbital periods of 0.1-10 days, with a median of {\textasciitilde}2 days, are produced from binaries with much longer periods (10 to {\textasciitilde}105 days), consistent with observations indicating that most or all short-period binaries have distant companions (tertiaries). We also make two new testable predictions: (1) For periods between 3 and 10 days, the distribution of the mutual inclination between the inner binary and the tertiary orbit should peak strongly near 40° and 140°. (2) Extrasolar planets whose host stars have a distant binary companion may also undergo this process, in which case the orbit of the resulting hot Jupiter will typically be misaligned with the equator of its host star. This work is dedicated to the late Bohdan Paczyński, who inspired it.},

We study how it might arrive at such an orbit and how it has avoided being tidally circularized until now. The presence of a stellar companion to the host star suggests the possibility that the Kozai mechanism and tidal dissipation combined to draw the planet inward well after it formed: Kozai oscillations produce periods of extreme eccentricity in the planet orbit, and the tidal dissipation that occurs during these periods of small pericenter distances leads to gradual orbital decay. We call this migration mechanism the "Kozai migration." It requires that the initial planet orbit be highly inclined relative to the binary orbit. For a companion at 1000 AU and an initial planet orbit at 5 AU, the minimum relative inclination required is 85°. We discuss the efficiency of tidal dissipation inferred from the observations of exoplanets. Moreover, we investigate possible explanations for the velocity residual (after the motion induced by the planet is removed) observed on the host star: a second planet in the system is excluded over a large extent of semimajor axis space if Kozai migration is to work, and the tide raised on the star by HD 80606b is likely too small in amplitude. Last, we discuss the relevance of Kozai migration for other planetary systems.},

	abstract = {THE recent discoveries1–4 of massive planetary companions orbiting several solar-type stars pose a conundrum. Conventional models5,6 for the formation of giant planets (such as Jupiter and Saturn) place such objects at distances of several astronomical units from the parent star, whereas all but one of the new objects are on orbits well inside 1 AU; these planets must therefore have originated at larger distances and subsequently migrated inwards. One suggested migration mechanism invokes tidal interactions between the planet and the evolving circumstellar disk7. Such a mechanism results in planets with small, essentially circular orbits, which appears to be the case for many of the new planets. But two of the objects have substantial orbital eccentricities, which are difficult to reconcile with a tidal-linkage model. Here we describe an alternative model for planetary migration that can account for these large orbital eccentricities. If a system of three or more giant planets form about a star, their orbits may become unstable as they gain mass by accreting gas from the circumstellar disk; subsequent gravitational encounters among these planets can eject one from the system while placing the others into highly eccentric orbits both closer and farther from the star.},

	abstract = {The discovery of high incidence of hot Jupiters in dense clusters challenges the field-based hot Jupiter formation theory. In dense clusters, interactions between planetary systems and flyby stars are relatively common. This has a significant impact on planetary systems, dominating hot Jupiter formation. In this paper, we perform high precision, few-body simulations of stellar flybys and subsequent planet migration in clusters. A large parameter space exploration demonstrates that close flybys that change the architecture of the planetary system can activate high eccentricity migration mechanisms: LK and planet-planet scattering, leading to high hot Jupiter formation rate in dense clusters. Our simulations predict that many of the hot Jupiters are accompanied by "ultra-cold Saturns," expelled to apastra of thousands of astronomical units. This increase is particularly remarkable for planetary systems originally hosting two giant planets with semimajor axis ratios of ∼4 and the flyby star approaching nearly perpendicular to the planetary orbital plane. The estimated lower limit to the hot Jupiter formation rate of a virialized cluster is \${\textbackslash}sim 1.6{\textbackslash}times \{10\}{\textasciicircum}\{-4\}\{({\textbackslash}sigma /1{\textbackslash}mathrm\{km\}\{\{{\textbackslash}rm\{s\}\}\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\})\}{\textasciicircum}\{5\}\{(\{a\}\_\{\{{\textbackslash}rm\{p\}\}\}/20{\textbackslash}mathrm\{au\})(\{M\}\_\{\{{\textbackslash}rm\{c\}\}\}/1000\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \})\}{\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\$ Gyr-1 per star, where σ is the cluster velocity dispersion, ap is the size of the planetary system, and Mc is the mass of the cluster. Our simulations yield a hot Jupiter abundance that is ∼50 times smaller than that observed in the old open cluster M67. We expect that interactions involving binary stars, as well as a third or more giant planets, will close the discrepancy.},

	abstract = {A recent observational study suggests that the occurrence of hot Jupiters (HJs) around solar-type stars is correlated with stellar clustering. We study a new scenario for HJ formation, called “Flyby Induced High-e Migration,” that may help explain this correlation. In this scenario, stellar flybys excite the eccentricity and inclination of an outer companion (giant planet, brown dwarf, or low-mass star) at large distance (10–300 au), which then triggers high-e migration of an inner cold Jupiter (at a few astronomical units) through the combined effects of von Zeipel–Lidov–Kozai (ZLK) eccentricity oscillation and tidal dissipation. Using semianalytical calculations of the effective ZLK inclination window, together with numerical simulations of stellar flybys, we obtain the analytic estimate for the HJ occurrence rate in this formation scenario. We find that this “flyby induced high-e migration” could account for a significant fraction of the observed HJ population, although the result depends on several uncertain parameters, including the density and lifetime of birth stellar clusters, and the occurrence rate of the “cold Jupiter + outer companion” systems.},

	abstract = {Exoplanetary observations reveal that the occurrence rate of hot Jupiters is correlated with star clustering. In star clusters, interactions between planetary systems and close flyby stars can significantly change the architecture of primordially coplanar, circular planetary systems. Flybys can impact hot Jupiter formation via activation of high-eccentricity excitation mechanisms such as the Zeipel–Lidov–Kozai (ZLK) effect and planet–planet scattering. Previous studies have shown that, for a two-planet system, close flybys, especially at high incidence angles, can efficiently activate the ZLK mechanism, thus triggering high-eccentricity tidal migration and ultimately form hot Jupiters. Here, we extend our previous study with a multiplanet (triple) system. We perform high-precision, high-accuracy few-body simulations of stellar flybys and subsequent planetary migration within the perturbed planetary systems using the code spacehub. Our simulations demonstrate that a single close flyby on a multiplanet system can activate secular chaos and ultimately lead to hot Jupiter formation via high-eccentricity migration. We find that the hot Jupiter formation rate per system increases with both the size of the planetary system and the mass of the outer planet, and we quantify the relative formation fractions for a range of parameters. Hot Jupiters formed via secular chaos are expected to be accompanied by massive companions with very long periods. Our study further shows that flyby-induced secular chaos is preferred in low-density clusters where multiplanet systems are more likely to survive, and that it contributes a significant fraction of hot Jupiter formation in star clusters compared to the flyby-induced ZLK mechanism.},

In a system containing two Jupiter-like planets, the possibility exists that a dynamical instability will develop. Computer simulations suggest that in many cases this instability leads to the ejection of one planet while the other is left in a smaller, eccentric orbit. In extreme cases, the eccentric orbit has a small enough periastron distance that it may circularize at an orbital period as short as a few days through tidal dissipation. This may explain the recently detected Jupiter-mass planets in very tight circular orbits and wider eccentric orbits around nearby stars.},

A homogeneous analysis of these newly collected light curves together with archived spectroscopic, photometric, and Doppler velocimetric data using EXOFASTv2 leads to a significant improvement in the physical and orbital parameters of each system. All of our stellar radii are constrained to accuracies of better than 3\%. The planetary radii for 37 of our 39 targets are determined to accuracies of better than 5\%. Compared to our results, the literature eccentricities are preferentially overestimated due to the Lucy-Sweeney bias. Our new photometric observations therefore allow for significant improvement in the orbital ephemerides of each system. Our correction of the future transit window amounts to a change exceeding 10 minutes for 10 targets at the time of James Webb Space Telescope's launch, including a 72 minutes change for WASP-56. The measured transit midtimes for both literature light curves and our new photometry show no significant deviations from the updated linear ephemerides, ruling out in each system the presence of companion planets with masses greater than 0.39-5.0 M⊕, 1.23-14.36 M⊕, 1.65-21.18 M⊕, and 0.69-6.75 M⊕ near the 1:2, 2:3, 3:2, and 2:1 resonances with the hot Jupiters, respectively, at a confidence level of ±1σ.

A lack of planet candidates nearby hot Jupiters in the TESS data supports results from previous transit searches of each individual system, now down to the photometric precision of TESS. This is consistent with expectations from a high-eccentricity migration formation scenario, but additional formation indicators are needed for definitive confirmation. We injected transit signals into the light curves of the hot Jupiter sample to probe the pipeline's sensitivity to the target parameter space, finding a dependence proportional to \$\{R\}\_\{p\}{\textasciicircum}\{2.32\}\{P\}{\textasciicircum}\{-0.88\}\$ for planets within 0.3 ≤ R p ≤ 4 R ⊕ and 1 ≤ P ≤ 14 days.

HJs, with the singular exception of WASP-47b, do not have any detectable inner or outer planetary companions (with periods inward of 50 days and sizes down to 2 R Earth). Restricting ourselves to inner companions, our limits reach down to 1 R Earth. In stark contrast, half of the WJs are closely flanked by small companions. Statistically, the companion fractions for hot and WJs are mutually exclusive, particularly in regard to inner companions. The high companion fraction of WJs also yields clues to their formation. The WJs that have close-by siblings should have low orbital eccentricities and low mutual inclinations. The orbital configurations of these systems are reminiscent of those of the low-mass close-in planetary systems abundantly discovered by the Kepler mission. This, and other arguments, lead us to propose that these WJs are formed in situ. There are indications that there may be a second population of WJs with different characteristics. In this picture, WASP-47b could be regarded as the extending tail of the in situ WJs into the HJ region and does not represent the generic formation route for HJs.},

	abstract = {Using new data from the K2 mission, we show that WASP-47, a previously known hot Jupiter host, also hosts two additional transiting planets: a Neptune-sized outer planet and a super-Earth inner companion. We measure planetary properties from the K2 light curve and detect transit timing variations (TTVs), confirming the planetary nature of the outer planet. We performed a large number of numerical simulations to study the dynamical stability of the system and to find the theoretically expected TTVs. The theoretically predicted TTVs are in good agreement with those observed, and we use the TTVs to determine the masses of two planets, and place a limit on the third. The WASP-47 planetary system is important because companion planets can both be inferred by TTVs and are also detected directly through transit observations. The depth of the hot Jupiter's transits make ground-based TTV measurements possible, and the brightness of the host star makes it amenable for precise radial velocity measurements. The system serves as a Rosetta Stone for understanding TTVs as a planet detection technique.},

	abstract = {The first discovered extrasolar worlds-giant, "hot Jupiter" planets on short-period orbits-came as a surprise to solar system-centric models of planet formation, prompting the development of new theories for planetary system evolution. The near absence of observed nearby planetary companions to hot Jupiters has been widely quoted as evidence in support of high-eccentricity tidal migration, a framework in which hot Jupiters form further out in their natal protoplanetary disks before being thrown inward with extremely high eccentricities, stripping systems of any close-in planetary companions. In this work, we present new results from a search for transit timing variations across the full 4 yr Kepler data set, demonstrating that at least 12\% ± 6\% of hot Jupiters have a nearby planetary companion. This subset of hot Jupiters is expected to have a quiescent dynamical history such that the systems could retain their nearby companions. We also demonstrate a ubiquity of nearby planetary companions to warm Jupiters (≥70\% ± 16\%), indicating that warm Jupiters typically form quiescently. We conclude by combining our results with existing observational constraints to propose an "eccentric migration" framework for the formation of short-period giant planets through postdisk dynamical sculpting in compact multiplanet systems. Our framework suggests that hot Jupiters constitute the natural end stage for giant planets spanning a wide range of eccentricities, with orbits that reach small enough periapses-either from their final orbital configurations in the disk phase or from eccentricity excitation in the postdisk phase-to trigger efficient tidal circularization.},

	abstract = {It is often assumed that the “Kepler dichotomy”—the apparent excess of planetary systems with a single detected transiting planet in the Kepler catalog—reflects an intrinsic bimodality in the mutual inclinations of planetary orbits. After conducting 600 simulations of planet formation followed by simulated Kepler observations, we instead propose that the apparent dichotomy reflects a divergence in the amount of migration and the separation of planetary semimajor axes into distinct “clusters.” We find that our simulated high-mass systems migrate rapidly, bringing more planets into orbital periods of less than 200 days. The outer planets are often caught in a migration trap—a range of planet masses and locations in which a dominant corotation torque prevents inward migration—which splits the system into two clusters. If clusters are sufficiently separated, the inner cluster remains dynamically cold, leading to low mutual inclinations and a higher probability of detecting multiple transiting planets. Conversely, our simulated low-mass systems typically bring fewer planets within 200 days, forming a single cluster that quickly becomes dynamically unstable, leading to collisions and high mutual inclinations. We propose an alternative explanation for the apparent Kepler dichotomy in which migration traps during formation lead to fewer planets within the Kepler detection window, and where mutual inclinations play only a secondary role. If our scenario is correct, then Kepler’s Systems with Tightly packed Inner Planets are a sample of planets that escaped capture by corotation traps, and their sizes may be a valuable probe into the structure of protoplanetary disks.},

We cannot reproduce the observed excess of single transiting planets by only pumping inclination without driving most systems to dynamical instability. Thus, we expect the underlying planetary population for single transiting planets to contain an intrinsically low multiplicity component. We can reproduce the Kepler statistics and occurrence rates for R \&lt; 2 R⊕ planets with a perturber population consistent with that inferred from radial velocity surveys, but require too many giant planets if we wish to explain all planets with R \&lt; 4 R⊕. These numbers can be brought into agreement if we posit the existence of an equivalent size population of planets below the RV detection limit (of characteristic mass ∼0.1MJ). This population would need to be dynamically hot to produce sufficiently strong perturbations and would leave the imprint of high obliquities and eccentricities amongst the surviving planets. The histories of our perturbed populations also produce a significant number of planets that are lost by collision with the star and some that are driven to short orbital periods by the combined action of secular evolution and tidal dissipation. Some of our simulations also produce planetary systems with planets that survive in the habitable zone but have no planets interior to them – much as in the case of our Solar system.

Moreover, it seems that these systems might have distant companions, either planets, brown-dwarfs, or other stellar objects. These companions might be inclined with respect to the inner planets, and could potentially excite the eccentricities of the inner planets through the Eccentric Kozai-Lidov mechanism. These eccentricity excitations could perhaps cause the inner orbits to cross, disrupting the inner system. We study the stability of two-planet systems in the presence of a distant, inclined, giant planet. Specifically, we derive a stability criterion, which depends on the companion's separation and eccentricity. We show that our analytic criterion agrees with the results obtained from numerically integrating an ensemble of systems both secularly and with N-body simulations. Finally, as a potential proof-of-concept, we provide a set of predictions for the parameter space that allows the existence of planetary companions for the Kepler-56, Kepler-448, Kepler-88, Kepler-109, and Kepler-36 systems.},

In this paradigm, the vast majority of stars rapidly form along with multiple close-in planets in the mass range of Mars to super-Earths/mini-Neptunes. Such systems of tightly packed inner planets are metastable, with the time scale of the dynamical instability having a major influence on final planet types. In most cases, the planets consolidate into a system of fewer, more massive planets, but long after the circumstellar gas disk has dissipated. This can yield planets with masses above the traditional critical core of ∼10 M⊕, yielding short-period giants that lack abundant gas. A rich variety of physical states are also possible given the range of collisional outcomes and formation time of the close-in planets. However, when dynamical consolidation occurs before gas dispersal, a critical core can form that then grows via gas capture into a short-period gas giant. In this picture the majority of Hot and Warm Jupiters formed locally, rather than migrating down from larger distances.},

We use direct numerical simulations along with secular theory and synthetic secular frequency spectra to analyze how analogues of Kepler-11 and Kepler-90 behave in the presence of a nearly co-planar, Jupiter-like outer perturber with semimajor axes between 1 and 5.2 au. Most locations of the outer perturber do not affect the evolution of the inner planetary systems, apart from altering precession frequencies. However, there are locations at which an outer planet causes system instability due to, in part, secular eccentricity resonances. In Kepler-90, there is a range of orbital distances for which the outer perturber drives planets b and c, through secular interactions, onto orbits with inclinations that are ∼16° away from the rest of the planets. Kepler-90 is stable in this configuration. Such secular resonances can thus affect the observed multiplicity of transiting systems. We also compare the synthetic apsidal and nodal precession frequencies with the secular theory and find some misalignment between principal frequencies, indicative of strong interactions between the planets (consistent with the system showing TTVs). First-order libration angles are calculated to identify MMRs in the systems, for which two near-MMRs are shown in Kepler-90, with a 5:4 between b and c, as well as a 3:2 between g and h.},

These and subsequent observations inspired new theories of planet formation that invoke gravitation interactions in multiple planet systems to explain the excitation of orbital eccentricities and even short-period giant planets. Recently, NASA’s Kepler mission has identified over 300 systems with multiple transiting planet candidates, including many potentially rocky planets. Most of these systems include multiple planets with closely spaced orbits and sizes between that of Earth and Neptune. These systems represent yet another new and unexpected class of planetary systems and provide an opportunity to test the theories developed to explain the properties of giant exoplanets. Presently, we have limited knowledge about such planetary systems, mostly about their sizes and orbital periods. With the advent of long-term, nearly continuous monitoring by Kepler, the method of transit timing variations (TTVs) has blossomed as a new technique for characterizing the gravitational effects of mutual planetary perturbations for hundreds of planets. TTVs can provide precise, but complex, constraints on planetary masses, densities, and orbits, even for planetary systems with faint host stars. In the coming years, astronomers will translate TTV observations into increasingly powerful constraints on the formation and orbital evolution of planetary systems with low-mass planets. Between TTVs, improved Doppler surveys, high-contrast imaging campaigns, and microlensing surveys, astronomers can look forward to a much better understanding of planet formation in the coming decade.},

	abstract = {Planet formation occurs over a few Myr within protoplanetary discs of dust and gas, which are often assumed to evolve in isolation. However, extended gaseous structures have been uncovered around many protoplanetary discs, suggestive of late-stage in-fall from the interstellar medium (ISM). To quantify the prevalence of late-stage in-fall, we apply an excursion set formalism to track the local density and relative velocity of the ISM over the disc lifetime. We then combine the theoretical Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) accretion rate with a simple disc evolution model, anchoring stellar accretion time-scales to observational constraints. Disc lifetimes, masses, stellar accretion rates and gaseous outer radii as a function of stellar mass and age are remarkably well-reproduced by our simple model that includes only ISM accretion. We estimate \$20\{-\}70\$ percent of discs may be mostly composed of material accreted in the most recent half of their lifetime, suggesting disc properties are not a direct test of isolated evolution models. Our calculations indicate that BHL accretion can also supply sufficient energy to drive turbulence in the outer regions of protoplanetary discs with viscous \${\textbackslash}alpha\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{SS\} {\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{-5\}- 10{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$, although we emphasise that angular momentum transport and particularly accretion onto the star may still be driven by internal processes. Our simple approach can be easily applied to semi-analytic models. Our results represent a compelling case for regulation of planet formation by large-scale turbulence, with broad consequences for planet formation theory. This possibility urgently motivates deep observational surveys to confirm or refute our findings.},

The high-α sequence comprises mostly old stars, and the low-α sequence comprises primarily young stars. The origin of this dichotomy is uncertain. To better understand how the high- and low-α stars are affiliated, we examine if the high- and low-α sequences have distinct orbits at all ages, or if age sets the orbital properties of stars irrespective of their α-enhancement. Orbital actions J R , J z , and J ϕ (or L z ) are our labels of stellar dynamics. We use ages for 58,278 Large Sky Area Multi-object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) stars (measured to a precision of 40\%) within ≤2 kpc of the Sun and we calculate orbital actions from proper motions and parallaxes given by Gaia’s DR2. We find that at all ages, the high- and low-α sequences are dynamically distinct. This implies separate formation and evolutionary histories for the two sequences; a star’s membership in the high- or low-α sequence indicates its dynamical properties at a given time. We use action space to make an efficient selection of halo stars and subsequently report a group of old, low-α stars in the halo, which may be a discrete population from an infall event.},

	abstract = {The kinematics of the Milky Way disc as a function of age are well measured at the solar radius, but have not been studied over a wider range of Galactocentric radii. Here, we measure the kinematics of mono-age, mono-[Fe/H] populations in the low and high [α/Fe] discs between 4 ≲ R ≲ 13 kpc and {\textbar}z{\textbar} ≲ 2 kpc using 65 719 stars in common between APOGEE DR14 and Gaia DR2 for which we estimate ages using a Bayesian neural network model trained on asteroseismic ages. We determine the vertical and radial velocity dispersions, finding that the low and high [α/Fe] discs display markedly different age–velocity dispersion relations (AVRs) and shapes σz/σR. The high [α/Fe] disc has roughly flat AVRs and constant σz/σR = 0.64 ± 0.04, whereas the low [α/Fe] disc has large variations in this ratio that positively correlate with the mean orbital radius of the population at fixed age. The high [α/Fe] disc component’s flat AVRs and constant σz/σR clearly indicate an entirely different heating history. Outer disc populations also have flatter radial AVRs than those in the inner disc, likely due to the waning effect of spiral arms. Our detailed measurements of AVRs and σz/σR across the disc indicate that low [α/Fe], inner disc (\$R {\textbackslash}lesssim 10{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{kpc\}\$) stellar populations are likely dynamically heated by both giant molecular clouds and spiral arms, while the observed trends for outer disc populations require a significant contribution from another heating mechanism such as satellite perturbations. We also find that outer disc populations have slightly positive mean vertical and radial velocities likely because they are part of the warped disc.},

	abstract = {Stellar abundances and ages afford the means to link chemical enrichment to galactic formation. In the Milky Way, individual element abundances show tight correlations with age, which vary in slope across ([Fe/H]–[α/Fe]). Here, we step from characterizing abundances as measures of age, to understanding how abundances trace properties of stellar birth environment in the disk over time. Using measurements from ∼27,000 APOGEE stars (R = 22,500, signal-to-noise ratio {\textgreater} 200), we build simple local linear models to predict a sample of elements (X = Si, O, Ca, Ti, Ni, Al, Mn, Cr) using (Fe, Mg) abundances alone, as fiducial tracers of supernovae production channels. Given [Fe/H] and [Mg/H], we predict these elements, [X/H], to about double the uncertainty of their measurements. The intrinsic dispersion, after subtracting measurement errors in quadrature is ≈0.015–0.04 dex. The residuals of the prediction (measurement − model) for each element demonstrate that each element has an individual link to birth properties at fixed (Fe, Mg). Residuals from primarily massive-star supernovae (i.e., Si, O, Al) partially correlate with guiding radius. Residuals from primarily supernovae Ia (i.e., Mn, Ni) partially correlate with age. A fraction of the intrinsic scatter that persists at fixed (Fe, Mg), however, after accounting for correlations, does not appear to further discriminate between birth properties that can be traced with present-day measurements. Presumably, this is because the residuals are also, in part, a measure of the typical (in)-homogeneity of the disk’s stellar birth environments, previously inferred only using open cluster systems. Our study implies at fixed birth radius and time that there is a median scatter of ≈0.01–0.015 dex in elements generated in supernovae sources.},

	abstract = {Over the past two decades, an avalanche of new data from multiwavelength imaging and spectroscopic surveys has revolutionized our view of galaxy formation and evolution. Here we review the range of complementary techniques and theoretical tools that allow astronomers to map the cosmic history of star formation, heavy element production, and reionization of the Universe from the cosmic “dark ages” to the present epoch. A consistent picture is emerging, whereby the star-formation rate density peaked approximately 3.5 Gyr after the Big Bang, at z≈1.9, and declined exponentially at later times, with an e-folding timescale of 3.9 Gyr. Half of the stellar mass observed today was formed before a redshift z = 1.3. About 25\% formed before the peak of the cosmic star-formation rate density, and another 25\% formed after z = 0.7. Less than ∼1\% of today's stars formed during the epoch of reionization. Under the assumption of a universal initial mass function, the global stellar mass density inferred at any epoch matches reasonably well the time integral of all the preceding star-formation activity. The comoving rates of star formation and central black hole accretion follow a similar rise and fall, offering evidence for coevolution of black holes and their host galaxies. The rise of the mean metallicity of the Universe to about 0.001 solar by z = 6, one Gyr after the Big Bang, appears to have been accompanied by the production of fewer than ten hydrogen Lyman-continuum photons per baryon, a rather tight budget for cosmological reionization.},

In all three wave bands, L increases markedly with redshift. For a (q0 = 0.5, Omega = 1.0) cosmological model, the comoving luminosity density increases as (1 + z)2.1 +/- 0.5 at 1 mu m, as (1 + z)2.7 +/- 0.5 at 4400 A, and as (1 + z)3.9 +/- 0.75 at 2800 A, these exponents being reduced by 0.43 and 1.12 for (0.05, 0.1) and (-0.85, 0.1) cosmological models, respectively. The L ( lambda )- tau relation can be reasonably well modeled by an actively evolving stellar population with a Salpeter initial mass function (IMF) extending to 125 M⊙, and a star formation rate declining as tau -2.5 with a turn-on of star formation at early epochs. A Scalo IMF extending to the same mass limit produces too many long-lived low-mass stars. This rapid evolution of the star formation rate and comoving luminosity density of the universe is in good agreement with the conclusions of Pei \& Fall from their analysis of the evolving metallicity of the universe. One consequence of this evolution is that the physical luminosity density at short wavelengths has probably declined by 2 orders of magnitude since z {\textasciitilde} 1.},

	abstract = {We develop a method for interpreting faint galaxy data which focuses on the integrated light radiated from the galaxy population as a whole. The emission history of the universe at ultraviolet, optical, and near-infrared wavelengths is modeled from the present epoch to z {\textasciitilde} 4 by tracing the evolution with cosmic time of the galaxy luminosity density, as determined from several deep spectroscopic samples and the Hubble Deep Field (HDF) imaging survey. In a q0 = 0.5, h50 = 1 cosmology, the global spectrophotometric properties of field galaxies can be well fitted by a simple stellar evolution model, defined by a time-dependent star formation rate (SFR) per unit comoving volume and a universal initial mass function (IMF) extending from 0.1 to 125 M⊙. While a Salpeter IMF with a modest amount of dust reddening or a somewhat steeper mass function, φ(m) {\textasciitilde} m-2.7, can both reproduce the data reasonably well, a Scalo IMF produces too much long-wavelength light and is unable to match the observed mean galaxy colors. In the best-fit models, the global SFR rises sharply, by about an order of magnitude, from a redshift of zero to a peak value at z {\textasciitilde} 1.5 in the range 0.12-0.17 M⊙ yr-1 Mpc-3, to fall again at higher redshifts. After integrating the inferred star formation rate over cosmic time, we find a stellar mass density at the present epoch of Ωsh250{\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}0.005, hence a mean stellar mass-to-light ratio {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}4 in the B-band and {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}1 in K, consistent with the values observed in nearby galaxies of various morphological types. The models are able to account for the entire background light recorded in the galaxy counts down to the very faint magnitude levels probed by the HDF. Since only {\textasciitilde}20\% of the current stellar content of galaxies is produced at z {\textgreater} 2, a rather low cosmic metallicity is expected at these early times, in good agreement with the observed enrichment history of the damped Lyα systems. The biggest uncertainty is represented by the poorly constrained amount of starlight that was absorbed by dust and reradiated in the IR at early epochs. A ``monolithic collapse'' model, where half of the present-day stars formed at z {\textgreater} 2.5 and were shrouded by dust, can be made consistent with the global history of light, but overpredicts the metal mass density at high redshifts as sampled by quasi-stellar object absorbers.},

	abstract = {Strong constraints on the cosmic star formation history (SFH) have recently been established using ultraviolet and far-infrared measurements, refining the results of numerous measurements over the past decade. The data show a compellingly consistent picture of the SFH out to redshift z{\textasciitilde}6, with especially tight constraints for z{\textless}{\textasciitilde}1. We fit these data with simple analytical forms and derive conservative uncertainties. Since the z{\textless}{\textasciitilde}1 SFH data are quite precise, we investigate the sequence of assumptions and corrections that together affect the SFH normalization to test their accuracy, both in this redshift range and beyond. As lower limits on this normalization, we consider the evolution in stellar and metal mass densities, and supernova rate density, finding it unlikely that the SFH normalization is much lower than indicated by our direct fit. As a corresponding upper limit on the SFH normalization, we consider the Super-Kamiokande limit on the electron antineutrino (νe) flux from past core-collapse supernovae, which applies primarily to z{\textless}{\textasciitilde}1. We find consistency with the SFH only if the neutrino temperatures from supernova events are relatively modest. Constraints on the assumed initial mass function (IMF) also become apparent. The traditional Salpeter IMF, assumed for convenience by many authors, is known to be a poor representation at low stellar masses ({\textless}{\textasciitilde}1 Msolar), and we show that recently favored IMFs are also constrained. In particular, somewhat shallow, or top-heavy, IMFs may be preferred, although they cannot be too top-heavy. To resolve the outstanding issues, improved data are called for on the supernova rate density evolution, the ranges of stellar masses leading to core-collapse and type Ia supernovae, and the antineutrino and neutrino backgrounds from core-collapse supernovae.},

	abstract = {We develop a chemical evolution model to study the star formation history of the Milky Way. Our model assumes that the Milky Way has formed from a closed-box-like system in the inner regions, while the outer parts of the disc have experienced some accretion. Unlike the usual procedure, we do not fix the star formation prescription (e.g. Kennicutt law) to reproduce the chemical abundance trends. Instead, we fit the abundance trends with age to recover the star formation history of the Galaxy. Our method enables us to recover the star formation history of the Milky Way in the first Gyrs with unprecedented accuracy in the inner ({\textless}i{\textgreater}R{\textless}i/{\textgreater} {\textless} 7−8 kpc) and outer ({\textless}i{\textgreater}R{\textless}i/{\textgreater} {\textgreater} 9−10 kpc) discs, as sampled in the solar vicinity. We show that half the stellar mass formed during the thick-disc phase in the inner galaxy during the first 4−5 Gyr. This phase was followed by a significant dip in star formation activity (at 8−9 Gyr) and a period of roughly constant lower-level star formation for the remaining 8 Gyr. The thick-disc phase has produced as many metals in 4 Gyr as the thin-disc phase in the remaining 8 Gyr. Our results suggest that a closed-box model is able to fit all the available constraints in the inner disc. A closed-box system is qualitatively equivalent to a regime where the accretion rate maintains a high gas fraction in the inner disc at high redshift. In these conditions the SFR is mainly governed by the high turbulence of the interstellar medium. By {\textless}i{\textgreater}z{\textless}i/{\textgreater} {\textasciitilde} 1 it is possible that most of the accretion takes place in the outer disc, while the star formation activity in the inner disc is mostly sustained by the gas that is not consumed during the thick-disc phase and the continuous ejecta from earlier generations of stars. The outer disc follows a star formation history very similar to that of the inner disc, although initiated at {\textless}i{\textgreater}z{\textless}i/{\textgreater} {\textasciitilde} 2, about 2 Gyr before the onset of the thin-disc formation in the inner disc.},

	abstract = {The dynamical history of stars influences the formation and evolution of planets significantly. To explore the influence of dynamical history on the planet formation and evolution using observations, we assume stars that experienced significantly different dynamical histories tend to have different relative velocities. Utilizing the accurate Gaia–Kepler Stellar Properties Catalog, we select single main-sequence stars and divide these stars into three groups according to their relative velocities, i.e., high-V, medium-V, and low-V stars. After considering the known biases from Kepler data and adopting prior and posterior correction to minimize the influence of stellar properties on planet occurrence rate, we find that high-V stars have a lower occurrence rate of super-Earths and sub-Neptunes (1–4 R ⊕, P {\textless} 100 days) and a higher occurrence rate of sub-Earth (0.5–1 R ⊕, P {\textless} 30 days) than low-V stars. Additionally, high-V stars have a lower occurrence rate of hot Jupiter-sized planets (4–20 R ⊕, P {\textless} 10 days) and a slightly higher occurrence rate of warm or cold Jupiter-sized planets (4–20 R ⊕, 10 {\textless} P {\textless} 400 days). After investigating multiplicity and eccentricity, we find that high-V planet hosts prefer a higher fraction of multiplanet systems and lower average eccentricity, which are consistent with the eccentricity–multiplicity dichotomy of Kepler planetary systems. All of these statistical results favor the scenario that high-V stars with large relative velocity may experience fewer gravitational events, while low-V stars may be influenced by stellar clustering significantly.},

	abstract = {The stellar birth environment can significantly shorten protoplanetary disc (PPD) lifetimes due to the influence of stellar feedback mechanisms. The degree to which these mechanisms suppress the time and mass available for planet formation is dependent on the local far-ultraviolet (FUV) field strength, stellar density, and ISM properties. In this work, we present the first theoretical framework quantifying the distribution of PPD dispersal time-scales as a function of parameters that describe the galactic environment. We calculate the probability density function for FUV flux and stellar density in the solar neighbourhood. In agreement with previous studies, we find that external photoevaporation is the dominant environment-related factor influencing local stellar populations after the embedded phase. Applying our general prescription to the Central Molecular Zone of the Milky Way (I.e. the central ∼ 250 pc), we predict that 90 per cent of PPDs in the region are destroyed within 1 Myr of the dispersal of the parent molecular cloud. Even in such dense environments, we find that external photoevaporation is the dominant disc depletion mechanism over dynamical encounters between stars. PPDs around low-mass stars are particularly sensitive to FUV-induced mass-loss, due to a shallower gravitational potential. For stars of mass ∼1 M⊙, the solar neighbourhood lies at approximately the highest gas surface density for which PPD dispersal is still relatively unaffected by external FUV photons, with a median PPD dispersal time-scale of ∼4 Myr. We highlight the key questions to be addressed to further contextualize the significance of the local galactic environment for planet formation.},

	abstract = {The σ Orionis cluster is important for studying protoplanetary disk evolution, as its intermediate age (∼3-5 Myr) is comparable to the median disk lifetime. We use ALMA to conduct a high-sensitivity survey of dust and gas in 92 protoplanetary disks around σ Orionis members with M * ≳ 0.1 M ⊙. Our observations cover the 1.33 mm continuum and several CO J = 2-1 lines: out of 92 sources, we detect 37 in the millimeter continuum and 6 in 12CO, 3 in 13CO, and none in C18O. Using the continuum emission to estimate dust mass, we find only 11 disks with M dust ≳ 10 M ⊕, indicating that after only a few Myr of evolution most disks lack sufficient dust to form giant planet cores. Stacking the individually undetected continuum sources limits their average dust mass to 5× lower than that of the faintest detected disk, supporting theoretical models that indicate rapid dissipation once disk clearing begins. Comparing the protoplanetary disk population in σ Orionis to those of other star-forming regions supports the steady decline in average dust mass and the steepening of the M dust-M * relation with age; studying these evolutionary trends can inform the relative importance of different disk processes during key eras of planet formation. External photoevaporation from the central O9 star is influencing disk evolution throughout the region: dust masses clearly decline with decreasing separation from the photoionizing source, and the handful of CO detections exist at projected separations of {\textgreater}1.5 pc. Collectively, our findings indicate that giant planet formation is inherently rare and/or well underway by a few Myr of age.},

	abstract = {We present observational evidence of environmental effects on the formation and evolution of planetary systems. We combine catalogues of resolved protoplanetary discs (PPDs) and young stellar objects in the solar neighbourhood to analyse the PPD size distribution as a function of ambient stellar density. By running Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests between the PPD radii at different densities, we find empirical evidence, at the {\textgreater}97\% confidence level, for a change in the PPD radius distribution at ambient stellar densities Σ ≳ 103.5 pc-2. This coincides with a simple theoretical estimate for the truncation of PPDs or planetary systems by dynamical encounters. If this agreement is causal, the ongoing disruption of PPDs and planetary systems limits the possible existence of planets in the habitable zone, with shorter lifetimes at higher host stellar masses and ambient densities. Therefore, habitable planets are not likely to be present in long-lived stellar clusters, and may have been ejected altogether to form a population of unbound, free-floating planets. We conclude that, while highly suggestive, our results should be verified through other methods. Our simple model shows that truncations should lead to a measurable depletion of the PPD mass function that can be detected with ALMA observations of the densest nearby and young clusters.

	abstract = {Due to the high stellar densities in young clusters, planetary systems formed in these environments are likely to have experienced perturbations from encounters with other stars. We carry out direct N-body simulations of multiplanet systems in star clusters to study the combined effects of stellar encounters and internal planetary dynamics. These planetary systems eventually become part of the Galactic field population as the parental cluster dissolves, which is where most presently known exoplanets are observed. We show that perturbations induced by stellar encounters lead to distinct signatures in the field planetary systems, most prominently, the excited orbital inclinations and eccentricities. Planetary systems that form within the cluster's half-mass radius are more prone to such perturbations. The orbital elements are most strongly excited in the outermost orbit, but the effect propagates to the entire planetary system through secular evolution. Planet ejections may occur long after a stellar encounter. The surviving planets in these reduced systems tend to have, on average, higher inclinations and larger eccentricities compared to systems that were perturbed less strongly. As soon as the parental star cluster dissolves, external perturbations stop affecting the escaped planetary systems, and further evolution proceeds on a relaxation time-scale. The outer regions of these ejected planetary systems tend to relax so slowly that their state carries the memory of their last strong encounter in the star cluster. Regardless of the stellar density, we observe a robust anticorrelation between multiplicity and mean inclination/eccentricity. We speculate that the `Kepler dichotomy' observed in field planetary systems is a natural consequence of their early evolution in the parental cluster.},

	abstract = {When stars form within small groups (with N*{\textasciitilde}100-500 members), their circumstellar disks are exposed to relatively little extreme-ultraviolet (EUV; hν{\textgreater}13.6 eV) radiation but a great deal of far-ultraviolet (FUV; 6eV3 times the local interstellar FUV field) from the most massive stars in the group. This paper calculates the mass-loss rates and evaporation timescales for circumstellar disks exposed to external FUV radiation. Previous work treated large disks and/or intense radiation fields in which the disk radius rd exceeds the critical radius rg where the sound speed in the FUV heated surface layer exceeds the escape speed; it has often been assumed that photoevaporation occurs for rd{\textgreater}rg and is negligible for rdg. Since rg{\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}100 AU for FUV heating, this would imply little mass loss from the planet-forming regions of a disk. In this paper we focus on systems in which photoevaporation is suppressed because rdg and show that significant mass loss still takes place as long as rd/rg{\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}0.1-0.2. Some of the gas extends beyond the disk edge (or above the disk surface) to larger distances where the temperature is higher, the escape speed is lower, and an outflow develops. The resulting evaporation rate is a sensitive function of the central stellar mass and disk radius, which determine the escape speed, and the external FUV flux, which determines the temperature structure of the surface layers and outflowing gas. Disks around red dwarfs, low-mass stars with M*{\textless}{\textasciitilde}0.5 Msolar, are evaporated and shrink to disk radii rd{\textless}{\textasciitilde}15 AU on short timescales t{\textless}{\textasciitilde}10 Myr when exposed to moderate FUV fields with G0=3000 (where G0=1.7 for the local interstellar FUV field). The disks around solar-type stars are more durable. For intense FUV radiation fields with G0=30,000, however, even these disks shrink to rd{\textless}{\textasciitilde}15 AU on timescales t{\textasciitilde}10 Myr. Such fields exist within about 0.7 pc of the center of a cluster with N*{\textasciitilde}4000 stars. If our solar system formed in the presence of such strong FUV radiation fields, this mechanism could explain why Neptune and Uranus in our solar system are gas-poor, whereas Jupiter and Saturn are relatively gas-rich. This mechanism for photoevaporation can also limit the production of Kuiper Belt objects and can suppress giant planet formation in sufficiently large clusters, such as the Hyades, especially for disks associated with low-mass stars.},

	abstract = {We employ the first two years of data from the near-infrared, high-resolution SDSS-III/APOGEE spectroscopic survey to investigate the distribution of metallicity and α-element abundances of stars over a large part of the Milky Way disk. Using a sample of ≈10, 000 kinematically unbiased red-clump stars with ∼5\% distance accuracy as tracers, the [α/Fe] versus [Fe/H] distribution of this sample exhibits a bimodality in [α/Fe] at intermediate metallicities, −0.9 {\textless} [Fe/H] {\textless}−0.2, but at higher metallicities ([Fe/H] ∼+0.2) the two sequences smoothly merge. We investigate the effects of the APOGEE selection function and volume filling fraction and find that these have little qualitative impact on the α-element abundance patterns. The described abundance pattern is found throughout the range 5 {\textless} R {\textless} 11 kpc and 0 {\textless} {\textbar}Z{\textbar} {\textless} 2 kpc across the Galaxy. The [α/Fe] trend of the high-α sequence is surprisingly constant throughout the Galaxy, with little variation from region to region (∼10\%). Using simple galactic chemical evolution models, we derive an average star-formation efficiency (SFE) in the high-α sequence of ∼4.5 × 10−10 yr−1, which is quite close to the nearly constant value found in molecular-gas-dominated regions of nearby spirals. This result suggests that the early evolution of the Milky Way disk was characterized by stars that shared a similar star-formation history and were formed in a well-mixed, turbulent, and molecular-dominated ISM with a gas consumption timescale (SFE−1) of ∼2 Gyr. Finally, while the two α-element sequences in the inner Galaxy can be explained by a single chemical evolutionary track, this cannot hold in the outer Galaxy, requiring, instead, a mix of two or more populations with distinct enrichment histories.},

Our spectroscopic observations have allowed us to constrain spectral type, temperatures, and, in some cases, metallicities for 337 out of 561 probable mid-type M dwarfs in the primary Kepler field. We use a random forest classifier to assign a spectral type to the remaining 224 stars. Combining our data with Gaia parallaxes, we compute precise (∼3\%) stellar radii and masses, which we use to update planet parameters and occurrence rates for Kepler mid-type M dwarfs. Within the Kepler field, there are seven M3 V to M5 V stars that host 13 confirmed planets between 0.5 and 2.5 Earth radii and at orbital periods between 0.5 and 10 days. For this population, we compute a planet occurrence rate of \{1.19\}-0.49+0.70 planets per star. For M3 V, M4 V, and M5 V, we compute planet occurrence rates of \{0.86\}-0.68+1.32, \{1.36\}-1.02+2.30, and \{3.07\}-2.49+5.49 planets per star, respectively.},

	abstract = {Most structural and evolutionary properties of galaxies strongly rely on the stellar initial mass function (IMF), namely the distribution of the stellar mass formed in each episode of star formation1-4. The IMF shapes the stellar population in all stellar systems, and so has become one of the most fundamental concepts of modern astronomy. Both constant and variable IMFs across different environments have been claimed despite a large number of theoretical5-7 and observational efforts8-15. However, the measurement of the IMF in Galactic stellar populations has been limited by the relatively small number of photometrically observed stars, leading to high uncertainties12-16. Here we report a star-counting result based on approximately 93,000 spectroscopically observed M-dwarf stars, an order of magnitude more than previous studies, in the 100-300 parsec solar neighbourhood. We find unambiguous evidence of a variable IMF that depends on both metallicity and stellar age. Specifically, the stellar population formed at early times contains fewer low-mass stars compared with the canonical IMF, independent of stellar metallicities. In more recent times, however, the proportion of low-mass stars increases with stellar metallicity. The variable abundance of low-mass stars in our Milky Way establishes a powerful benchmark for models of star formation and can heavily affect results in Galactic chemical-enrichment modelling, mass estimation of galaxies and planet-formation efficiency.},

(2013). These data show 899 transiting planet candidates in 365 multiple-planet systems and provide a powerful means to study the statistical properties of planetary systems. Using a generic mass–radius relationship, we find that only two pairs of planets in these candidate systems (out of 761 pairs total) appear to be on Hill-unstable orbits, indicating ∼96\% of the candidate planetary systems are correctly interpreted as true systems. We find that planet pairs show little statistical preference to be near mean-motion resonances. We identify an asymmetry in the distribution of period ratios near first-order resonances (e.g., 2:1, 3:2), with an excess of planet pairs lying wide of resonance and relatively few lying narrow of resonance. Finally, based upon the transit duration ratios of adjacent planets in each system, we find that the interior planet tends to have a smaller transit impact parameter than the exterior planet does. This finding suggests that the mode of the mutual inclinations of planetary orbital planes is in the range 1.°0–2.°2, for the packed systems of small planets probed by these observations.},

	abstract = {The sample of host stars with multiple transiting planets has illuminated the orbital architectures of exoplanetary systems. These architectures may be shaped mostly by formation conditions, be continually sculpted by ongoing dynamical processes, or both. As more studies have placed planet occurrence within a galactic context, evidence has emerged for variable planet multiplicity over time. In this manuscript, we investigate the use of transit multiplicity as a tool to constrain longer-timescale ({\textgreater}1 Gyr) dynamical sculpting. First, with a suite of injection-and-recovery tests, we quantify sensitivity to sculpting laws across different regimes. We employ a forward modeling framework in which we generate synthetic planetary systems, according to a prescribed sculpting speed and timescale, around the FGK dwarfs studied by the Kepler Mission. Some sculpting scenarios are hypothetically detectable in the Kepler sample, while others can be disfavored from Kepler transit statistics alone. Second, we apply our analysis to reverse engineer the sculpting laws consistent with the true yield from Kepler. We confirm the present-day fraction of host stars containing dynamically cool "systems with tightly packed inner planets" is 4\%–13\%. A variety of Gyr-timescale sculpting laws successfully predict the transit multiplicity of the Kepler sample, but none of these laws succeed in also producing a detectable trend with transit multiplicity and stellar age. An improvement to measured stellar age precision may help uncover such a sculpting law, but nevertheless reflects limitations in transit multiplicity as an observable. Therefore, other phenomena, apart from Gyr-timescale dynamical sculpting, may be required to explain the Kepler yield.},

We apply the method to announced Kepler planet candidates that transit solar-type stars. The Kepler team's estimates of the detection efficiency are used and are shown to agree with theoretical predictions for an ideal transit survey. The PLDF is fit to a joint power law in planet radius, down to 0.5 R ⊕, and orbital period, up to 50 days. The estimated number of planets per star in this sample is {\textasciitilde}0.7-1.4, where the range covers systematic uncertainties in the detection efficiency. To analyze trends in the PLDF we consider four planet samples, divided between shorter and longer periods at 7 days and between large and small radii at 3 R ⊕. The size distribution changes appreciably between these four samples, revealing a relative deficit of {\textasciitilde}3 R ⊕ planets at the shortest periods. This deficit is suggestive of preferential evaporation and sublimation of Neptune- and Saturn-like planets. If the trend and explanation hold, it would be spectacular observational support of the core accretion and migration hypotheses, and would allow refinement of these theories.},

	abstract = {M dwarf stars are not only the most promising hosts for detection and characterization of small and potentially habitable planets, they provide leverage relative to solar-type stars to test models of planet formation and evolution. Using Gaia astrometry, adaptive optics imaging, and calibrated gyrochronologic relations to estimate stellar properties, filter binaries, and assign ages, we refined the radii of 179 transiting planets orbiting 119 single late K- and early M-type stars detected by the Kepler mission, and assigned stellar rotation-based ages ) to 115 of these. We constructed the radius distribution of {\textless}4R\$\_\{{\textbackslash}oplus\}\$ planets and assessed its evolution with time. As for solar-type stars, the inferred distribution contains distinct populations of "super-Earths" (at {\textasciitilde}1.3R\$\_\{{\textbackslash}oplus\}\$) and "sub-Neptunes" (at {\textasciitilde}2.2Rearth) separated by a gap or "valley" at \${\textbackslash}approx\$1.7R\$\_\{{\textbackslash}oplus\}\$ that has a period dependence that is significantly weaker (power law index of -0.026\${\textasciicircum}\{+0.026\}\_\{-0.017\}\$) than for solar-type stars. Sub-Neptunes are largely absent at short periods (\${\textless}\$2 days) and high irradiance, a feature analogous to the "Neptune desert" observed around solar-type stars. The relative number of sub-Neptunes to super-Earths declines between the younger and older halves of the sample (median age 3.8 Gyr), although the formal significance is low (\$p = 0.06\$) because of the small sample size. The decline in sub-Neptunes appears to be more pronounced at long orbital periods vs. short periods; this is not due to detection bias and could indicate that these objects are inflated by a mechanism that operates at elevated irradiance, e.g. a runaway water greenhouse augmented by H/He.},

Based on light-curve analysis, adaptive-optics imaging, and optical spectroscopy at low and high resolution (including radial velocity measurements), we validate 16 planets around 12 low-mass stars observed during K2 campaigns 5-10. Among the 16 planets, 12 are newly validated, with orbital periods ranging from 0.96 to 33 days. For one of the planets (K2-151b), we present ground-based transit photometry, allowing us to refine the ephemerides. Combining our K2 M-dwarf planets together with the validated or confirmed planets found previously, we investigate the dependence of planet radius R p on stellar insolation and metallicity [Fe/H]. We confirm that for periods P ≲ 2 days, planets with a radius \{R\}p≳ 2 \{R\}{\textbackslash}oplus are less common than planets with a radius between 1-2 R ⊕. We also see a hint of the “radius valley” between 1.5 and 2 R ⊕, which has been seen for close-in planets around FGK stars. These features in the radius/period distribution could be attributed to photoevaporation of planetary envelopes by high-energy photons from the host star, as they have for FGK stars. For the M dwarfs, though, the features are not as well defined, and we cannot rule out other explanations such as atmospheric loss from internal planetary heat sources or truncation of the protoplanetary disk. There also appears to be a relation between planet size and metallicity: the few planets larger than about 3 R ⊕ are found around the most metal-rich M dwarfs.},

	abstract = {Chemical evolution models are powerful tools for interpreting stellar abundance surveys and understanding galaxy evolution. However, their predictions depend heavily on the treatment of inflow, outflow, star formation efficiency (SFE), the stellar initial mass function, the SN Ia delay time distribution, stellar yields, and stellar population mixing. Using flexCE, a flexible one-zone chemical evolution code, we investigate the effects of and trade-offs between parameters. Two critical parameters are SFE and the outflow mass-loading parameter, which shift the knee in [O/Fe]-[Fe/H] and the equilibrium abundances that the simulations asymptotically approach, respectively. One-zone models with simple star formation histories follow narrow tracks in [O/Fe]-[Fe/H] unlike the observed bimodality (separate high-α and low-α sequences) in this plane. A mix of one-zone models with inflow timescale and outflow mass-loading parameter variations, motivated by the inside-out galaxy formation scenario with radial mixing, reproduces the two sequences better than a one-zone model with two infall epochs. We present [X/Fe]-[Fe/H] tracks for 20 elements assuming three different supernova yield models and find some significant discrepancies with solar neighborhood observations, especially for elements with strongly metallicity-dependent yields. We apply principal component abundance analysis to the simulations and existing data to reveal the main correlations among abundances and quantify their contributions to variation in abundance space. For the stellar population mixing scenario, the abundances of α-elements and elements with metallicity-dependent yields dominate the first and second principal components, respectively, and collectively explain 99\% of the variance in the model. flexCE is a python package available at https://github.com/bretthandrews/flexCE.},

	abstract = {Aims: We study the chemical evolution of the disks of the Milky Way (MW) and of Andromeda (M 31), to identify the common properties and differences between the two major galaxies of the Local Group. Methods: We use a large set of observational data for M 31, including observations of the star formation rate (SFR) and gas profiles, as well as stellar metallicity distributions along its disk. When expressed in terms of the corresponding disk scale lengths, we show that the observed radial profiles of MW and M 31 exhibit interesting similarities, suggesting the possibility of a description within a common framework. Results: We find that the profiles of stars, gas fraction, and metallicity of the two galaxies, as well as most of their global properties, are well described by our model, provided that the star formation efficiency in M 31 disk is twice as high as in the MW. We show that the star formation rate profile of M 31 cannot be described by any form of the Kennicutt-Schmidt law (KS Law) for star formation. We propose that these discrepancies are caused by the fact that M 31 has an active star formation history in the recent past, consistent with the hypotheses of a “head-on” collision with the neighboring galaxy (most probably M 32) about 200 Myr ago. Conclusions: The MW has most probably experienced quiescent secular evolution, making possible a fairly successful description with a simple model. If M 31 is more typical of spiral galaxies, more complex models, involving galaxy interactions, will be required for the description of spirals.},

We present ananke, a framework for generating synthetic phase-space surveys from high-resolution baryonic simulations, and use it to generate a suite of synthetic surveys resembling Gaia DR2 in data structure, magnitude limits, and observational errors. We use three cosmological simulations of Milky Way-mass galaxies from the Latte suite of the Feedback In Realistic Environments project, which feature self-consistent clustering of star formation in dense molecular clouds and thin stellar/gaseous disks in live cosmological halos with satellite dwarf galaxies and stellar halos. We select three solar viewpoints from each simulation to generate nine synthetic Gaia-like surveys. We sample synthetic stars by assuming each star particle (of mass 7070 M ⊙) represents a single stellar population. At each viewpoint, we compute dust extinction from the simulated gas metallicity distribution and apply a simple error model to produce a synthetic Gaia-like survey that includes both observational properties and a pointer to the generating star particle. We provide the complete simulation snapshot at z = 0 for each simulated galaxy. We describe data access points, the data model, and plans for future upgrades. These synthetic surveys provide a tool for the scientific community to test analysis methods and interpret Gaia data.},

	abstract = {We study the structure, age and metallicity gradients, and dynamical evolution using a cosmological zoom-in simulation of a Milky Way-mass galaxy from the Feedback in Realistic Environments project. In the simulation, stars older than 6 Gyr were formed in a chaotic, bursty mode and have the largest vertical scale heights (1.5-2.5 kpc) by z=0, while stars younger than 6 Gyr were formed in a relatively calm, stable disk. The vertical scale height increases with stellar age at all radii, because (1) stars that formed earlier were thicker "at birth", and (2) stars were kinematically heated to an even thicker distribution after formation. Stars of the same age are thicker in the outer disk than in the inner disk (flaring). These lead to positive vertical age gradients and negative radial age gradients. The radial metallicity gradient is neg- ative at the mid-plane, flattens at larger disk height {\textbar}Z{\textbar}, and turns positive above {\textbar}Z{\textbar}{\textasciitilde}1.5kpc. The vertical metallicity gradient is negative at all radii, but is steeper at smaller radii. These trends broadly agree with observations in the Milky Way and can be naturally understood from the age gradients. The vertical stellar density profile can be well-described by two components, with scale heights 200-500 pc and 1-1.5 kpc, respectively. The thick component is a mix of stars older than 4 Gyr which formed through a combination of several mechanisms. Our results also demonstrate that it is possible to form a thin disk in cosmological simulations even with strong stellar feedback.},

	abstract = {We analyse the heating of stellar discs by non-axisymmetric structures and giant molecular clouds (GMCs) in N-body simulations of growing disc galaxies. The analysis resolves long-standing discrepancies between models and data by demonstrating the importance of distinguishing between measured age-velocity dispersion relations (AVRs) and the heating histories of the stars that make up the AVR. We fit both AVRs and heating histories with formulae ∝tβ and determine the exponents βR and βz derived from in-plane and vertical AVRs and tilde\{β \}\_R and tilde\{β \}\_z from heating histories. Values of βz are in almost all simulations larger than values of tilde\{β \}\_z, whereas values of βR are similar to or mildly larger than values of tilde\{β \}\_R. Moreover, values of βz (tilde\{β \}\_z) are generally larger than values of βR (tilde\{β \}\_R). The dominant cause of these relations is the decline over the life of the disc in importance of GMCs as heating agents relative to spiral structure and the bar. We examine how age errors and biases in solar neighbourhood surveys influence the measured AVR: they tend to decrease β values by smearing out ages and thus measured dispersions. We compare AVRs and velocity ellipsoid shapes σz/σR from simulations to solar neighbourhood data. We conclude that for the expected disc mass and dark halo structure, combined GMC and spiral/bar heating can explain the AVR of the Galactic thin disc. Strong departures of the disc mass or the dark halo structure from expectation spoil fits to the data.},

	abstract = {The early stages of a galaxy's evolution leave an imprint on its metallicity distribution. We discuss the origins and evolution of radial metallicity gradients in discs of spiral galaxies using an analytical chemical evolution model. We explain how radial metallicity gradients in stellar populations are determined by three factors: the radial metallicity profile of the star-forming interstellar medium (ISM), radial changes in the star formation history (in particular, inside-out formation) and radial mixing of stars. Under reasonable assumptions, inside-out formation steepens the negative ISM metallicity gradient, but contributes positively to the stellar metallicity gradient, up to inverting the metallicity profile to a positive d[Fe/H]/dR. This reconciles steep negative d[Fe/H]/dR in some high-redshift galaxies to generally flatter gradients in local observations. We discuss the evidence for inverse radial metallicity gradients (positive d[X/H]/dR) at high redshifts and the inverse relationship between azimuthal velocity and the metallicity (positive dVϕ/d[Fe/H]) of stars for the Milky Way's thick disc. The former can be achieved by high central gas-loss rates and re-distribution processes, e.g. re-accretion of enriched material in conjunction with the inside-out formation and near-disc galactic fountaining. For the Milky Way-thick disc, we show that the positive dVϕ/d[Fe/H] correlation points to comparable time-scales for inside-out formation, initial metal enrichment and SNIa enrichment. We argue that the original ISM metallicity gradient could be inferred with better data from the high-metallicity tail of the alpha-enhanced population. Including inside-out formation in our models changes the local vertical metallicity gradient by about −0.2 dex  kpc−1, in line with local measurements.},

Analysis of this unprecedentedly large sample confirms the previously detected decrease in the fraction of magnetically active stars (as traced by Hα emission) as a function of the vertical distance from the Galactic plane. The magnitude and slope of this effect vary as a function of spectral type. Using simple 1D dynamical models, we demonstrate that the drop in activity fraction can be explained by thin-disk dynamical heating and a rapid decrease in magnetic activity. The timescale for this rapid activity decrease changes according to the spectral type. By comparing our data to the simulations, we calibrate the age-activity relation at each M dwarf spectral type. We also present evidence for a possible decrease in the metallicity as a function of height above the Galactic plane. In addition to our activity analysis, we provide line measurements, molecular band indices, colors, radial velocities, 3D space motions, and mean properties as a function of spectral type for the SDSS DR5 low-mass star sample.},

We first explore the distributions of mono-age populations in their birth and current locations, [Fe/H], and [X/Fe], and find evidence for inside-out radial growth for stars with ages {\textless}7 Gyr. We then examine the age–[X/Fe] relations across m12i’s disk and find that the direction of the trends agrees with observations, apart from C, O, and Ca, with remarkably small intrinsic scatters, σ int (0.01 − 0.04 dex). This σ int measured in the simulations is also metallicity dependent, with σ int ≈ 0.025 dex at [Fe/H] = −0.25 dex versus σ int ≈ 0.015 dex at [Fe/H] = 0 dex, and a similar metallicity dependence is seen in the GALAH survey for the elements in common. Additionally, we find that σ int is higher in the inner galaxy, where stars are older and formed in less chemically homogeneous environments. The age–[X/Fe] relations and the small scatter around them indicate that simulations capture similar chemical enrichment variance as observed in the Milky Way, arising from stars sharing similar element abundances at a given birth place and time.},

Motivated by the development of more accurate numerics - including hydrodynamic solvers, gravitational softening, and supernova coupling algorithms - and exploration of new physics (e.g. magnetic fields), we introduce `FIRE-2', an updated numerical implementation of FIRE physics for the GIZMO code. We run a suite of simulations and compare against FIRE-1: overall, FIRE-2 improvements do not qualitatively change galaxy-scale properties. We pursue an extensive study of numerics versus physics. Details of the star formation algorithm, cooling physics, and chemistry have weak effects provided that we include metal-line cooling and star formation occurs at higher-than-mean densities. We present new resolution criteria for high-resolution galaxy simulations. Most galaxy-scale properties are robust to numerics we test, provided: (1) Toomre masses are resolved; (2) feedback coupling ensures conservation, and (3) individual supernovae are time-resolved. Stellar masses and profiles are most robust to resolution, followed by metal abundances and morphologies, followed by properties of winds and circum-galactic media. Central (∼kpc) mass concentrations in massive ({\textgreater}L*) galaxies are sensitive to numerics (via trapping/recycling of winds in hot haloes). Multiple feedback mechanisms play key roles: supernovae regulate stellar masses/winds; stellar mass-loss fuels late star formation; radiative feedback suppresses accretion on to dwarfs and instantaneous star formation in discs.

As the number of observationally determined stellar abundances continues to climb, these simulations are able to provide new constraints on the early star formaton history and chemical evolution inside both the Milky Way and Local Group dwarf galaxies. Here, we aim to reproduce the low α-element scatter observed in metal-poor stars. We first demonstrate that as stellar particles inside simulations drop below a mass threshold, increases in the resolution produce an unacceptably large scatter as one particle is no longer a good approximation of an entire stellar population. This threshold occurs at around 103M⊙, a mass limit easily reached in current (and future) simulations. By simulating the Sextans and Fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxies we show that this increase in scatter at high resolutions arises from stochastic supernovae explosions. In order to reduce this scatter down to the observed value, we show the necessity of introducing a metal mixing scheme into particle-based simulations. The impact of the method used to inject the metals into the surrounding gas is also discussed. We finally summarise the best approach for accurately reproducing the scatter in simulations of both Local Group dwarf galaxies and in the Milky Way.},

	abstract = {Stable, hydrogen-burning, M dwarf stars make up about 75\% of all stars in the Galaxy. They are extremely long-lived, and because they are much smaller in mass than the Sun (between 0.5 and 0.08 MSun), their temperature and stellar luminosity are low and peaked in the red. We have re-examined what is known at present about the potential for a terrestrial planet forming within, or migrating into, the classic liquid–surface–water habitable zone close to an M dwarf star. Observations of protoplanetary disks suggest that planet-building materials are common around M dwarfs, but N-body simulations differ in their estimations of the likelihood of potentially habitable, wet planets that reside within their habitable zones, which are only about one-fifth to 1/50th of the width of that for a G star. Particularly in light of the claimed detection of the planets with masses as small as 5.5 and 7.5 MEarth orbiting M stars, there seems no reason to exclude the possibility of terrestrial planets. Tidally locked synchronous rotation within the narrow habitable zone does not necessarily lead to atmospheric collapse, and active stellar flaring may not be as much of an evolutionarily disadvantageous factor as has previously been supposed. We conclude that M dwarf stars may indeed be viable hosts for planets on which the origin and evolution of life can occur. A number of planetary processes such as cessation of geothermal activity or thermal and nonthermal atmospheric loss processes may limit the duration of planetary habitability to periods far shorter than the extreme lifetime of the M dwarf star. Nevertheless, it makes sense to include M dwarf stars in programs that seek to find habitable worlds and evidence of life. This paper presents the summary conclusions of an interdisciplinary workshop (http://mstars.seti.org) sponsored by the NASA Astrobiology Institute and convened at the SETI Institute.

The outermost planets (Kepler-62e and -62f) are super-Earth-size (1.25 \&lt; planet radius ≤ 2.0 R⊕) planets in the habitable zone (HZ) of their host star, receiving 1.2 ± 0.2 and 0.41 ± 0.05 times the solar flux at Earth's orbit (S☉). Theoretical models of Kepler-62e and -62f for a stellar age of  7 Gyr suggest that both planets could be solid, either with a rocky composition or composed of mostly solid water in their bulk.},

However, exoplanets with nonzero eccentricities could have spin-orbit resonance states different from the synchronous rotation state. Here, we show that a striped-ball climate pattern, with a global belt of open water at low and middle latitudes and ice over both polar regions, should be common on habitable exoplanets in eccentric orbits around M dwarfs. We further show that these different climate patterns can be observed by future exoplanet detection missions.},

	url = {https://arxiv.org/abs/1305.2270},
	abstract = {Ground based radial velocity (RV) searches continue to discover exoplanets below Neptune mass down to Earth mass. Furthermore, ground based transit searches now reach milli-mag photometric precision and can discover Neptune size planets around bright stars. These searches will find exoplanets around bright stars anywhere on the sky, their discoveries representing prime science targets for further study due to the proximity and brightness of their host stars. A mission for transit follow-up measurements of these prime targets is currently lacking. The first ESA S-class mission CHEOPS (CHaracterizing ExoPlanet Satellite) will fill this gap. It will perform ultra-high precision photometric monitoring of selected bright target stars almost anywhere on the sky with sufficient precision to detect Earth sized transits. It will be able to detect transits of RV-planets by photometric monitoring if the geometric configuration results in a transit. For Hot Neptunes discovered from the ground, CHEOPS will be able to improve the transit light curve so that the radius can be determined precisely. Because of the host stars' brightness, high precision RV measurements will be possible for all targets. All planets observed in transit by CHEOPS will be validated and their masses will be known. This will provide valuable data for constraining the mass-radius relation of exoplanets, especially in the Neptune-mass regime. During the planned 3.5 year mission, about 500 targets will be observed. There will be 20\% of open time available for the community to develop new science programmes.},

Connectedness refers to the interrelated welfare of the individual, one's family, one's community, and the natural environment. We developed an 18-item quantitative assessment of awareness of connectedness and tested it with 284 Alaska Native youth. Evaluation with confirmatory factor analysis and item response theory identified a 12-item subset that functions satisfactorily in a second-order four-factor model. The proposed Awareness of Connectedness Scale (ACS) displays good convergent and discriminant validity, and correlates positively with hypothesized protective factors such as reasons for living and communal mastery. The measure has utility in the study of culture-specific protective factors and as an outcomes measure for behavioral health programs with Native American youth.

	abstract = {The MEarth Project is a photometric survey systematically searching the smallest stars near the Sun for transiting rocky planets. Since 2008, MEarth has taken approximately two million images of 1844 stars suspected to be mid-to-late M dwarfs. We have augmented this survey by taking nightly exposures of photometric standard stars and have utilized this data to photometrically calibrate the MEarth system, identify photometric nights, and obtain an optical magnitude with 1.5\% precision for each M dwarf system. Each optical magnitude is an average over many years of data, and therefore should be largely immune to stellar variability and flaring. We combine this with trigonometric distance measurements, spectroscopic metallicity measurements, and 2MASS infrared magnitude measurements in order to derive a color–magnitude–metallicity relation across the mid-to-late M dwarf spectral sequence that can reproduce spectroscopic metallicity determinations to a precision of 0.1 dex. We release optical magnitudes and metallicity estimates for 1567 M dwarfs, many of which did not have an accurate determination of either prior to this work. For an additional 277 stars without a trigonometric parallax, we provide an estimate of the distance, assuming solar neighborhood metallicity. We find that the median metallicity for a volume-limited sample of stars within 20 pc of the Sun is [Fe/H] = −0.03 ± 0.008, and that 29/565 of these stars have a metallicity of [Fe/H] = −0.5 or lower, similar to the low-metallicity distribution of nearby G dwarfs. When combined with the results of ongoing and future planet surveys targeting these objects, the metallicity estimates presented here will be important for assessing the significance of any putative planet–metallicity correlation.},

We examine communal goal incongruence—the mismatch between students' emphasis on communal work goals and the noncommunal culture of STEM—as a possible factor in this underrepresentation. First, we surveyed 80 Native American STEM freshmen and found they more highly endorsed communal goals than individualistic work goals. Next, we surveyed 96 Native American and White American students in STEM and non-STEM majors and confirmed that both Native American men and women in STEM highly endorsed communal goals. In a third study, we conducted a follow-up survey and in-depth interviews with a subset of Native American STEM students in their second semester to assess their experiences of belonging uncertainty, intrinsic motivation, persistence intentions, and perceived performance in STEM as a function of their initial communal work goals. Results demonstrate the prominence of communal goals among incoming Native American freshman (especially compared with White male STEM majors) and the connection between communal goals and feelings of belonging uncertainty, low motivation, and perceived poor performance 1 semester later. The interview data illustrate that these issues are particularly salient for students raised within tribal communities, and that a communal goal orientation is not just a vague desire to “help others,” but a commitment to helping their tribal communities. The interviews also highlight the importance of student support programs for fostering feelings of belonging. We end by discussing implications for interventions and institutional changes that may promote Native American student retention in STEM.

The results from our prospective longitudinal study demonstrated that underrepresented minority student (URM) research assistants who see the altruistic value of conducting biomedical research feel more psychologically involved with their research over time, which, in turn, enhances their interest in pursuing a scientific research career. These altruistic motives are uniquely influential to URM students and appear to play an important role in influencing their interest in scientific research careers. Furthermore, seeing how research can potentially affect society and help one's community does not replace typical motives for scientific discovery (e.g., passion, curiosity, achievement), which are important for all students. These findings point to simple strategies for educators, training directors, and faculty mentors to improve retention among undergraduate URM students in biomedicine and the related sciences.},

	abstract = {Students from several ethnic minority groups are underrepresented in the sciences, such that minority students more frequently drop out of the scientific career path than non-minority students. Viewed from a perspective of social influence, this pattern suggests that minority students do not integrate into the scientific community at the same rate as non-minority students. Kelman (1958, 2006) describes a tripartite integration model of social influence (TIMSI) by which a person orients to a social system. To test if this model predicts integration into the scientific community, we conducted analyses of data from a national panel of minority science students. A structural equation model framework showed that self-efficacy (operationalized consistent with Kelman's 'rule-orientation') predicted student intentions to pursue a scientific career. However, when identification as a scientist and internalization of values are added to the model, self-efficacy becomes a poorer predictor of intention. Additional mediation analyses support the conclusion that while having scientific self-efficacy is important, identifying with and endorsing the values of the social system reflect a deeper integration and more durable motivation to persist as a scientist.},

We report on the science-related environmental factors and person factors that influence the longitudinal regulation of goal orientations. Further, we examine how goal orientations in turn influence distal academic outcomes such as performance and persistence in STEM. Using SEM-based parallel process latent growth curve modeling, we found that (a) engagement in undergraduate research was the only factor that buffered underrepresented students against an increase in performance-avoidance goals over time; (b) growth in scientific self-identity exhibited a strong positive effect on growth in task and performance-approach goals over time; (c) only task goals positively influenced students' cumulative grade point average, over and above baseline grade point average; and (d) performance-avoidance goals predicted student attrition from the STEM pipeline.

@article{Leconte15,
	title = {Asynchronous rotation of {Earth}-mass planets in the habitable zone of lower-mass stars},
	volume = {347},
	abstract = {On Earth, we’re accustomed to cycles of day and night, which drive a complex thermal relationship between the ground and atmosphere. Some exoplanets very close to their stars aren’t so lucky and are generally assumed to be locked by tides into hemispheres of unchanging day and night. The thick atmosphere of Venus is thought to keep it from the same fate, but Leconte et al. present models showing that even a much sparser atmosphere may suffice for lower-mass stars. The non-instantaneous thermal response of the planet (when the hottest time of day is after noon) may speed up or slow down the planet. Such thermal tides may be important in assessing potential extraterrestrial habitable zones.Science, this issue p. 632 Planets in the habitable zone of lower-mass stars are often assumed to be in a state of tidally synchronized rotation, which would considerably affect their putative habitability. Although thermal tides cause Venus to rotate retrogradely, simple scaling arguments tend to attribute this peculiarity to the massive Venusian atmosphere. Using a global climate model, we show that even a relatively thin atmosphere can drive terrestrial planets’ rotation away from synchronicity. We derive a more realistic atmospheric tide model that predicts four asynchronous equilibrium spin states, two being stable, when the amplitude of the thermal tide exceeds a threshold that is met for habitable Earth-like planets with a 1-bar atmosphere around stars more massive than  0.5 to 0.7 solar mass. Thus, many recently discovered terrestrial planets could exhibit asynchronous spin-orbit rotation, even with a thin atmosphere.},

	doi = {10.1002/essoar.10507239.1},
	abstract = {Several geological evidences, such as tidal rhythmites and bivalve shells, allow to track back the evolution paths of both the major semiaxis of the Moon’s orbit and the Earth’s spin rate. However, the data is scarce and with large uncertainty and the orbital evolution of the Moon is still controversial. The aim of this work is to evaluate how significant could have been the effect of bodily tides on the Earth’s mantle thermal evolution. To this end, different thermal models of the Earth’s interior were proposed. We explore plate tectonics and stagnant lid regimes. These models take into account both tidal and radiogenic heat sources. In order to compute tidal dissipation, we made use of three realistic rheological models of Earth mantle and proposed three different dynamical evolution paths for the lunar major semiaxis and terrestrial length of day. It was found that the impact of tidal interaction could have been specially appreciable on the first hundreds million of years of the Earth’s history, provided that the mantle was at a higher temperature. In addition, we found that thermal evolution of Earth’s interior is mainly controlled by the rheological behavior of the mantle, which controls the amount of tidal heat produced, and by the dynamical evolution of the Earth-Moon system.},

	abstract = {Planets within the habitable zones of M dwarfs are likely to be synchronous rotators; in other words, one side is permanently illuminated while the other side is in perpetual darkness. We present results of three-dimensional simulations of the atmospheres of such planets, and comment on their possible habitability. Near the ground, a thermally direct longitudinal cell exists, transporting heat from the dayside to the nightside. The circulation is three-dimensional, with low-level winds returning mass to the dayside across the polar regions. Aloft, the zonally averaged winds display a pattern of strong superrotation due to these planets' finite (albeit small) rotation rate. With terrestrial values of insolation, a CO2/H2O atmosphere collapses, or condenses on the surface of the darkside, when surface pressure is approximately 30 mb, this value being much lower for a N2atmosphere. This temperature contrast is also sensitive to factors such as gravity, planetary radius, and IR optical depth τ. These results question the suitability of the concept of a habitable zone around M dwarfs that is independent of planetary parameters. If CO2partial pressure is controlled by the carbonate–silicate cycle, we find that these planets should have a minimum surface pressure of 1000–1500 mb of CO2, as this is the minimum pressure needed to support stable liquid water on the darkside at the inner edge of the habitable zone. We finally conclude that planets orbiting M stars can support atmospheres over a large range of conditions and, despite constraints such as stellar activity, are very likely to be habitable.},

	abstract = {1) Three indices of global climate have been monitored in the record of the past 450,000 years in Southern Hemisphere ocean-floor sediments. 2) Over the frequency range 10–4 to 10–5 cycle per year, climatic variance of these records is concentrated in three discrete spectral peaks at periods of 23,000, 42,000, and approximately 100,000 years. These peaks correspond to the dominant periods of the earth's solar orbit, and contain respectively about 10, 25, and 50 percent of the climatic variance. 3) The 42,000-year climatic component has the same period as variations in the obliquity of the earth's axis and retains a constant phase relationship with it. 4) The 23,000-year portion of the variance displays the same periods (about 23,000 and 19,000 years) as the quasi-periodic precession index. 5) The dominant, 100,000-year climatic component has an average period close to, and is in phase with, orbital eccentricity. Unlike the correlations between climate and the higher-frequency orbital variations (which can be explained on the assumption that the climate system responds linearly to orbital forcing), an explanation of the correlation between climate and eccentricity probably requires an assumption of nonlinearity. 6) It is concluded that changes in the earth's orbital geometry are the fundamental cause of the succession of Quaternary ice ages. 7) A model of future climate based on the observed orbital-climate relationships, but ignoring anthropogenic effects, predicts that the long-term trend over the next several thousand years is toward extensive Northern Hemisphere glaciation.},

	abstract = {The results of large-scale exoplanet transit surveys indicate that the distribution of small planet radii is likely sculpted by atmospheric loss. Several possible physical mechanisms exist for this loss of primordial atmospheres, each of which produces a different set of observational signatures. In this study, we investigate the impact-driven mode of atmosphere loss via N-body simulations. We compare the results from giant impacts, at a demographic level, to results from another commonly invoked method of atmosphere loss, photoevaporation. Applying two different loss prescriptions to the same sets of planets, we then examine the resulting distributions of planets with retained primordial atmospheres. As a result of this comparison, we identify two new pathways toward discerning the dominant atmospheric-loss mechanism at work. Both of these pathways involve using transit multiplicity as a diagnostic, in examining the results of follow-up atmospheric and radial velocity surveys.},

The outermost planets (Kepler-62e and -62f) are super-Earth-size (1.25 \&lt; planet radius ≤ 2.0 R⊕) planets in the habitable zone (HZ) of their host star, receiving 1.2 ± 0.2 and 0.41 ± 0.05 times the solar flux at Earth's orbit (S☉). Theoretical models of Kepler-62e and -62f for a stellar age of  7 Gyr suggest that both planets could be solid, either with a rocky composition or composed of mostly solid water in their bulk.},

	title = {{CHEOPS}: {A} transit photometry mission for {ESA}'s small mission programme},
	volume = {47},
	url = {https://arxiv.org/abs/1305.2270},
	abstract = {Ground based radial velocity (RV) searches continue to discover exoplanets below Neptune mass down to Earth mass. Furthermore, ground based transit searches now reach milli-mag photometric precision and can discover Neptune size planets around bright stars. These searches will find exoplanets around bright stars anywhere on the sky, their discoveries representing prime science targets for further study due to the proximity and brightness of their host stars. A mission for transit follow-up measurements of these prime targets is currently lacking. The first ESA S-class mission CHEOPS (CHaracterizing ExoPlanet Satellite) will fill this gap. It will perform ultra-high precision photometric monitoring of selected bright target stars almost anywhere on the sky with sufficient precision to detect Earth sized transits. It will be able to detect transits of RV-planets by photometric monitoring if the geometric configuration results in a transit. For Hot Neptunes discovered from the ground, CHEOPS will be able to improve the transit light curve so that the radius can be determined precisely. Because of the host stars' brightness, high precision RV measurements will be possible for all targets. All planets observed in transit by CHEOPS will be validated and their masses will be known. This will provide valuable data for constraining the mass-radius relation of exoplanets, especially in the Neptune-mass regime. During the planned 3.5 year mission, about 500 targets will be observed. There will be 20\% of open time available for the community to develop new science programmes.},

	abstract = {New transiting planet candidates are identified in 16 months (2009 May-2010 September) of data from the Kepler spacecraft. Nearly 5000 periodic transit-like signals are vetted against astrophysical and instrumental false positives yielding 1108 viable new planet candidates, bringing the total count up to over 2300. Improved vetting metrics are employed, contributing to higher catalog reliability. Most notable is the noise-weighted robust averaging of multi-quarter photo-center offsets derived from difference image analysis that identifies likely background eclipsing binaries. Twenty-two months of photometry are used for the purpose of characterizing each of the candidates. Ephemerides (transit epoch, T 0, and orbital period, P) are tabulated as well as the products of light curve modeling: reduced radius (R P/R sstarf), reduced semimajor axis (d/R sstarf), and impact parameter (b). The largest fractional increases are seen for the smallest planet candidates (201\% for candidates smaller than 2 R ⊕ compared to 53\% for candidates larger than 2 R ⊕) and those at longer orbital periods (124\% for candidates outside of 50 day orbits versus 86\% for candidates inside of 50 day orbits). The gains are larger than expected from increasing the observing window from 13 months (Quarters 1-5) to 16 months (Quarters 1-6) even in regions of parameter space where one would have expected the previous catalogs to be complete. Analyses of planet frequencies based on previous catalogs will be affected by such incompleteness. The fraction of all planet candidate host stars with multiple candidates has grown from 17\% to 20\%, and the paucity of short-period giant planets in multiple systems is still evident. The progression toward smaller planets at longer orbital periods with each new catalog release suggests that Earth-size planets in the habitable zone are forthcoming if, indeed, such planets are abundant.},

	abstract = {We present the Kepler Object of Interest (KOI) catalog of transiting exoplanets based on searching 4 yr of Kepler time series photometry (Data Release 25, Q1–Q17). The catalog contains 8054 KOIs, of which 4034 are planet candidates with periods between 0.25 and 632 days. Of these candidates, 219 are new, including two in multiplanet systems (KOI-82.06 and KOI-2926.05) and 10 high-reliability, terrestrial-size, habitable zone candidates. This catalog was created using a tool called the Robovetter, which automatically vets the DR25 threshold crossing events (TCEs). The Robovetter also vetted simulated data sets and measured how well it was able to separate TCEs caused by noise from those caused by low signal-to-noise transits. We discuss the Robovetter and the metrics it uses to sort TCEs. For orbital periods less than 100 days the Robovetter completeness (the fraction of simulated transits that are determined to be planet candidates) across all observed stars is greater than 85\%. For the same period range, the catalog reliability (the fraction of candidates that are not due to instrumental or stellar noise) is greater than 98\%. However, for low signal-to-noise candidates between 200 and 500 days around FGK-dwarf stars, the Robovetter is 76.7\% complete and the catalog is 50.5\% reliable. The KOI catalog, the transit fits, and all of the simulated data used to characterize this catalog are available at the NASA Exoplanet Archive.},

	abstract = {Characterizing the dependence of the orbital architectures and formation environments on the eccentricity distribution of planets is vital for understanding planet formation. In this work, we perform statistical eccentricity studies of transiting exoplanets using transit durations measured via Kepler combined with precise and accurate stellar radii from the California-Kepler Survey and Gaia. Compared to previous works that characterized the eccentricity distribution from transit durations, our analysis benefits from both high-precision stellar radii (∼3\%) and a large sample of ∼1000 planets. We observe that systems with only a single observed transiting planet have a higher mean eccentricity () than systems with multiple transiting planets (), in agreement with previous studies. We confirm the preference for high- and low-eccentricity subpopulations among the single transiting systems. Finally, we show suggestive new evidence that high-e planets in the Kepler sample are preferentially found around high-metallicity ([Fe/H] {\textgreater} 0) stars. We conclude by discussing the implications on planetary formation theories.},

The outermost planets (Kepler-62e and -62f) are super-Earth-size (1.25 \&lt; planet radius ≤ 2.0 R⊕) planets in the habitable zone (HZ) of their host star, receiving 1.2 ± 0.2 and 0.41 ± 0.05 times the solar flux at Earth's orbit (S☉). Theoretical models of Kepler-62e and -62f for a stellar age of  7 Gyr suggest that both planets could be solid, either with a rocky composition or composed of mostly solid water in their bulk.},

	url = {https://arxiv.org/abs/1305.2270},
	abstract = {Ground based radial velocity (RV) searches continue to discover exoplanets below Neptune mass down to Earth mass. Furthermore, ground based transit searches now reach milli-mag photometric precision and can discover Neptune size planets around bright stars. These searches will find exoplanets around bright stars anywhere on the sky, their discoveries representing prime science targets for further study due to the proximity and brightness of their host stars. A mission for transit follow-up measurements of these prime targets is currently lacking. The first ESA S-class mission CHEOPS (CHaracterizing ExoPlanet Satellite) will fill this gap. It will perform ultra-high precision photometric monitoring of selected bright target stars almost anywhere on the sky with sufficient precision to detect Earth sized transits. It will be able to detect transits of RV-planets by photometric monitoring if the geometric configuration results in a transit. For Hot Neptunes discovered from the ground, CHEOPS will be able to improve the transit light curve so that the radius can be determined precisely. Because of the host stars' brightness, high precision RV measurements will be possible for all targets. All planets observed in transit by CHEOPS will be validated and their masses will be known. This will provide valuable data for constraining the mass-radius relation of exoplanets, especially in the Neptune-mass regime. During the planned 3.5 year mission, about 500 targets will be observed. There will be 20\% of open time available for the community to develop new science programmes.},

	abstract = {Motivated by the large number of compact extrasolar planetary systems discovered by the Kepler mission, this paper considers perturbations due to possible additional outer planets. The discovered compact systems sometimes contain multiple transiting planets, so that their orbital angular momentum vectors are tightly aligned. Since planetary orbits are susceptible to forced oscillations of their inclination angles, the highly aligned nature of these systems places constraints on possible additional (non-transiting) planets. If planets in the outer regions of these solar systems have sufficiently large mass or sufficiently small semi-major axis, they will induce the compact inner orbits to oscillate in and out of a transiting configuration. This paper considers the dynamics of the compact systems discovered to host five or more planets. In order not to perturb these systems out of a continually, mutually transiting state, additional planetary companions must generally have periastron p  \&gt; 10 au. Specific constraints are found for each of the 18 planetary systems considered, which are obtained by marginalizing over other orbital parameters using three different choices of priors for the companion properties (a uniform prior, a transit-inspired prior and a non-transiting disc prior). A separate ensemble of numerical experiments shows that these compact systems generally cannot contain Jupiter analogues without disrupting the observed orbits. We also consider how these constraints depend on system properties and find that the surface density of the planetary system is one of the most important variables. Finally, we provide specific results for two systems, WASP-47 and Kepler-20, for which this analysis provides interesting constraints.},

	abstract = {The final “giant-impact” phase of terrestrial planet formation is believed to begin with a large number of planetary “embryos” on nearly circular, coplanar orbits. Mutual gravitational interactions gradually excite their eccentricities until their orbits cross and they collide and merge; through this process the number of surviving bodies declines until the system contains a small number of planets on well-separated, stable orbits. In this paper we explore a simple statistical model for the orbit distribution of planets formed by this process, based on the sheared-sheet approximation and the ansatz that the planets explore uniformly all of the stable region of phase space. The model provides analytic predictions for the distribution of eccentricities and semimajor axis differences, correlations between orbital elements of nearby planets, and the complete N-planet distribution function, in terms of a single parameter, the “dynamical temperature,” that is determined by the planetary masses. The predicted properties are generally consistent with N-body simulations of the giant-impact phase and with the distribution of semimajor axis differences in the Kepler catalog of extrasolar planets. A similar model may apply to the orbits of giant planets if these orbits are determined mainly by dynamical evolution after the planets have formed and the gas disk has disappeared.},

	abstract = {New transiting planet candidates are identified in 16 months (2009 May-2010 September) of data from the Kepler spacecraft. Nearly 5000 periodic transit-like signals are vetted against astrophysical and instrumental false positives yielding 1108 viable new planet candidates, bringing the total count up to over 2300. Improved vetting metrics are employed, contributing to higher catalog reliability. Most notable is the noise-weighted robust averaging of multi-quarter photo-center offsets derived from difference image analysis that identifies likely background eclipsing binaries. Twenty-two months of photometry are used for the purpose of characterizing each of the candidates. Ephemerides (transit epoch, T 0, and orbital period, P) are tabulated as well as the products of light curve modeling: reduced radius (R P/R sstarf), reduced semimajor axis (d/R sstarf), and impact parameter (b). The largest fractional increases are seen for the smallest planet candidates (201\% for candidates smaller than 2 R ⊕ compared to 53\% for candidates larger than 2 R ⊕) and those at longer orbital periods (124\% for candidates outside of 50 day orbits versus 86\% for candidates inside of 50 day orbits). The gains are larger than expected from increasing the observing window from 13 months (Quarters 1-5) to 16 months (Quarters 1-6) even in regions of parameter space where one would have expected the previous catalogs to be complete. Analyses of planet frequencies based on previous catalogs will be affected by such incompleteness. The fraction of all planet candidate host stars with multiple candidates has grown from 17\% to 20\%, and the paucity of short-period giant planets in multiple systems is still evident. The progression toward smaller planets at longer orbital periods with each new catalog release suggests that Earth-size planets in the habitable zone are forthcoming if, indeed, such planets are abundant.},

In this work, we perform statistical eccentricity studies of transiting exoplanets using transit durations measured via Kepler combined with precise and accurate stellar radii from the California-Kepler Survey and Gaia. Compared to previous works that characterized the eccentricity distribution from transit durations, our analysis benefits from both high-precision stellar radii (∼3\%) and a large sample of ∼1000 planets. We observe that systems with only a single observed transiting planet have a higher mean eccentricity () than systems with multiple transiting planets (), in agreement with previous studies. We confirm the preference for high- and low-eccentricity subpopulations among the single transiting systems. Finally, we show suggestive new evidence that high-e planets in the Kepler sample are preferentially found around high-metallicity ([Fe/H] {\textgreater} 0) stars. We conclude by discussing the implications on planetary formation theories.},

The catalog contains 8054 KOIs, of which 4034 are planet candidates with periods between 0.25 and 632 days. Of these candidates, 219 are new, including two in multiplanet systems (KOI-82.06 and KOI-2926.05) and 10 high-reliability, terrestrial-size, habitable zone candidates. This catalog was created using a tool called the Robovetter, which automatically vets the DR25 threshold crossing events (TCEs). The Robovetter also vetted simulated data sets and measured how well it was able to separate TCEs caused by noise from those caused by low signal-to-noise transits. We discuss the Robovetter and the metrics it uses to sort TCEs. For orbital periods less than 100 days the Robovetter completeness (the fraction of simulated transits that are determined to be planet candidates) across all observed stars is greater than 85\%. For the same period range, the catalog reliability (the fraction of candidates that are not due to instrumental or stellar noise) is greater than 98\%. However, for low signal-to-noise candidates between 200 and 500 days around FGK-dwarf stars, the Robovetter is 76.7\% complete and the catalog is 50.5\% reliable. The KOI catalog, the transit fits, and all of the simulated data used to characterize this catalog are available at the NASA Exoplanet Archive.},

Recently it has been established in the literature that hierarchical adaptive priors based on splines with a random number of equally spaced knots and random coeﬃcients in the B-spline basis corresponding to those knots lead, under some conditions, to optimal posterior contraction rates, over certain smoothness functional classes. In this paper we extend these results for when the location of the knots is also endowed with a prior. This has already been a common practice in Markov chain Monte Carlo applications, but a theoretical basis in terms of adaptive contraction rates was missing. Under some mild assumptions, we establish a result that provides suﬃcient conditions for adaptive contraction rates in a range of models, over certain functional classes of smoothness up to the order of the splines that are used. We also present some numerical results illustrating how such a prior adapts to inhomogeneous variability (smoothness) of the function in the context of nonparametric regression.},

	abstract = {We present a new age-dating technique that combines gyrochronology with isochrone fitting to infer ages for FGKM main-sequence and subgiant field stars. Gyrochronology and isochrone fitting are each capable of providing relatively precise ages for field stars in certain areas of the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram: gyrochronology works optimally for cool main-sequence stars, and isochrone fitting can provide precise ages for stars near the main-sequence turnoff. Combined, these two age-dating techniques can provide precise and accurate ages for a broader range of stellar masses and evolutionary stages than either method used in isolation. We demonstrate that the position of a star on the Hertzsprung- Russell or color-magnitude diagram can be combined with its rotation period to infer a precise age via both isochrone fitting and gyrochronology simultaneously. We show that incorporating rotation periods with 5\% uncertainties into stellar evolution models improves age precision for FGK stars on the main sequence, and can, on average, provide age estimates up to three times more precise than isochrone fitting alone. In addition, we provide a new gyrochronology relation, calibrated to the Praesepe cluster and the Sun, that includes a variance model to capture the rotational behavior of stars whose rotation periods do not lengthen with the square-root of time, and parts of the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram where gyrochronology has not been calibrated. This publication is accompanied by an open source Python package, stardate, for inferring the ages of main-sequence and subgiant FGKM stars from rotation periods, spectroscopic parameters and/or apparent magnitudes and parallaxes.},

	abstract = {Precise Gaia measurements of positions, parallaxes, and proper motions provide an opportunity to calculate 3D positions and 2D velocities (i.e., 5D phase-space) of Milky Way stars. Where available, spectroscopic radial velocity (RV) measurements provide full 6D phase-space information, however there are now and will remain many stars without RV measurements. Without an RV it is not possible to directly calculate 3D stellar velocities; however, one can infer 3D stellar velocities by marginalizing over the missing RV dimension. In this paper, we infer the 3D velocities of stars in the Kepler ﬁeld in Cartesian Galactocentric coordinates (vx, vy, vz). We directly calculate velocities for around a quarter of all Kepler targets, using RV measurements available from the Gaia, LAMOST, and APOGEE spectroscopic surveys. Using the velocity distributions of these stars as our prior, we infer velocities for the remaining three quarters of the sample by marginalizing over the RV dimension. The median uncertainties on our inferred vx, vy, and vz velocities are around 4, 18, and 4 km s−1, respectively. We provide 3D velocities for a total of 148,590 stars in the Kepler ﬁeld. These 3D velocities could enable kinematic age-dating, Milky Way stellar population studies, and other scientiﬁc studies using the benchmark sample of wellstudied Kepler stars. Although the methodology used here is broadly applicable to targets across the sky, our prior is speciﬁcally constructed from and for the Kepler ﬁeld. Care should be taken to use a suitable prior when extending this method to other parts of the Galaxy.},

We perform a chemical and kinematic analysis of a subsample of AB Dor stream stars to test whether they constitute a physical stellar group. We use the NEMO Galactic kinematic code to investigate the orbits of the stream members, and perform a chemical abundance analysis using high resolution spectra taken with the Magellan Clay 6.5 m telescope. Using a χ2 test with the measured abundances for 10 different elements, we find that only half of the purported AB Dor stream members could possibly constitute a statistically chemically homogeneous sample. Some stream members with three-dimensional velocities were hundreds of parsecs from the AB Dor nucleus ∼108 yr ago, and hence were unlikely to share a common origin. We conclude that the published lists of AB Dor moving group stream members are unlikely to represent the dispersed remnant of a single star formation episode. A subsample of the stream stars appears to be both statistically chemically homogeneous and in the vicinity of the AB Dor nucleus at birth. Their mean metallicity is [Fe/H] = 0.02 ± 0.02 dex, which we consider representative for the AB Dor group. Finally, we report a strong lower limit on the age of the AB Dor nucleus of {\textgreater}110 Myr based on the pre-main sequence contraction times for K-type members which have reached the main sequence.},

We are able to recover gyrochronological ages for old, lower-main-sequence stars, a remarkable improvement over prior work in hotter stars. Under our model assumptions, our ages have a median relative uncertainty of 14\%, comparable to the age precision inferred for more massive stars using traditional methods. We investigate trends of Galactic α-enhancement with age, finding evidence of a detection threshold between the age of the oldest α-poor stars and that of the bulk α-rich population. We argue that gyrochronology is an effective tool reaching ages of 10–12 Gyr in K and early M dwarfs. Finally, we present the first effort to quantify the impact of detailed abundance patterns on rotational evolution. We estimate a ∼15\% bias in age for cool, α-enhanced (+0.4 dex) stars when standard solar-abundance-pattern rotational models are used for age inference, rather than models that appropriately account for α-enrichment.},

Since 2008, MEarth has taken approximately two million images of 1844 stars suspected to be mid-to-late M dwarfs. We have augmented this survey by taking nightly exposures of photometric standard stars and have utilized this data to photometrically calibrate the MEarth system, identify photometric nights, and obtain an optical magnitude with 1.5\% precision for each M dwarf system. Each optical magnitude is an average over many years of data, and therefore should be largely immune to stellar variability and flaring. We combine this with trigonometric distance measurements, spectroscopic metallicity measurements, and 2MASS infrared magnitude measurements in order to derive a color–magnitude–metallicity relation across the mid-to-late M dwarf spectral sequence that can reproduce spectroscopic metallicity determinations to a precision of 0.1 dex. We release optical magnitudes and metallicity estimates for 1567 M dwarfs, many of which did not have an accurate determination of either prior to this work. For an additional 277 stars without a trigonometric parallax, we provide an estimate of the distance, assuming solar neighborhood metallicity. We find that the median metallicity for a volume-limited sample of stars within 20 pc of the Sun is [Fe/H] = −0.03 ± 0.008, and that 29/565 of these stars have a metallicity of [Fe/H] = −0.5 or lower, similar to the low-metallicity distribution of nearby G dwarfs. When combined with the results of ongoing and future planet surveys targeting these objects, the metallicity estimates presented here will be important for assessing the significance of any putative planet–metallicity correlation.},

Using isochrone fitting, we find that the majority of these new groups have solar-type stars and solar-type metallicity. Among the 35 Oh et al. groups with five to nine members, we find that 19 also appear new and comoving, with Oh et al. Group 30 is particularly exciting as it is well within 100 pc (range of 77–90 pc) and also appears to be older than the Pleiades.

A mock Gaia sample is generated using the Gaia astrometry selection function, whilst realistic parallax uncertainties are drawn from the Gaia Astrometric Spread Function. The model is fit to the mock in order to rediscover the input parameters used to generate the sample. We recover posterior distributions that accurately fit the input parameters within statistical uncertainties, demonstrating the efficacy of our method. Using the GUMS synthetic Milky Way catalogue, we find that our halo parameter fits can be heavily biased by our overly simplistic model; however, the fits to the thin and thick discs are not significantly impacted. We apply this method to Gaia Early Data Release 3 in a companion paper where we also quantify the systematic uncertainties introduced by oversimplifications in our model.},

Among middle-aged M dwarfs, the most prolific hosts of close-in and detectable exoplanets, gyrochronology is the most promising method to assign ages, but requires calibration by rotation-temperature sequences (gyrochrones) in clusters of known ages. We curated a catalog of 249 late K- and M-type ((\$T\_\{eff\}\$=3200-4200K) exoplanet host stars with established rotation periods, and applied empirical, temperature-dependent rotation-age relations based on relevant published gyrochrones, including one derived from observations of the 4 Gyr-old open cluster M67. We estimated ages for 227 of these stars, and upper limits for 8 others, excluding 14 which have too rapidly rotating or are otherwise outside the valid parameter range of our gyrochronology. We estimated uncertainties based on observed scatter in rotation periods in young clusters, error in the gyrochrones, and uncertainties in temperature and non-solar metallicity. For those stars with measured metallicities, we provide but do not incorporate a correction for the effects of deviation from solar metallicity. The age distribution of our sample declines to near zero at 10 Gyr, the age of the Galactic disk, with the handful of outliers explainable by large uncertainties. Continued addition or extension of cluster rotation sequences to more thoroughly calibrate the gyrochronology in time and temperature space, more precise and robust measurement of rotation periods, and more accurate stellar parameter measurements will enable continued improvements in the age estimates of these important exoplanet host stars.},

We identify a total of four white dwarfs with distances, proper motions and cooling times which can be reconciled with membership of these populations. We find that WD J0643−203 in NGC 2287, with an estimated mass of M = 1.02–1.16 M ⊙ , is potentially the most massive white dwarf so far identified within an open cluster. Guided by the predictions of modern theoretical models of the late-stage evolution of heavy-weight intermediate-mass stars, we conclude that there is a distinct possibility that it has a core composed of O and Ne. We also determine that despite the cooling times of the three new white dwarfs in NGC 3532 and the previously known degenerate member NGC 3532−10 spanning ∼90 Myr, they all have remarkably similar masses ( M ∼ 0.9–1 M ⊙ ). This is fully consistent with the results from our previous work on a heterogeneous sample of ∼50 white dwarfs from 12 stellar populations, on the basis of which we argued that the stellar initial–final mass relation is less steep at Minit \&gt; 4 M ⊙ than in the adjacent lower initial mass regime. This change in the gradient of the relation could account for the secondary peak observed in the mass distribution of the field white dwarf population and mitigate the need to invoke close binary evolution to explain its existence. Spectroscopic investigation of numerous additional candidate white dwarf members of NGC 3532 unearthed by a recent independent study would be useful to confirm (or otherwise) these conclusions.},

	abstract = {Asteroseismic modelling of isolated star presents significant challenges due to the difficulty in accurately determining stellar parameters, particularly the stellar age. These challenges can be overcomed by observing stars in open clusters, whose coeval members share an initial chemical composition. The light curves by TESS allow us to investigate and analyse stellar variations in clusters with an unprecedented level. We aim to detect gravity-mode oscillations in the early-type main-sequence members of the young open cluster NGC 2516. We selected the 301 member stars as our sample and analysed the TESS FFI light curves. We also collected high-resolution spectra using the FEROS for the g-mode pulsators. By fitting the theoretical isochrones to the colour-magnitude diagram (CMD) of a cluster, we determined an age of 102 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 15 Myr and inferred the extinction at 550 nm (\$A\_0\$) is 0.53 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 0.04 mag. We identified 147 stars with surface brightness modulations, 24 with g-mode pulsations (\${\textbackslash}gamma\$ Doradus or Slowly Pulsating B stars), and 35 with p-mode pulsations (\${\textbackslash}delta\$ Sct stars). When sorted by colour index, the amplitude spectra of the \${\textbackslash}delta\$ Sct stars show a distinct ordering and reveal a discernible frequency-temperature relationship. The near-core rotation rates, measured from period spacing patterns in two SPB and nine \${\textbackslash}gamma\$ Dor stars, reach up to 3/d . This is at the high end of the values found from Kepler data of field stars of similar variability type. The \${\textbackslash}gamma\$ Dor stars have internal rotation rates as high as 50\% of their critical value, whereas the SPB stars exhibit rotation rates close to their critical rate. We did not find long-term brightness and colour variations in the mid-infrared, which suggests that there are no disk or shell formation events in our sample. We also discussed the results of our spectroscopic observations for the g-mode pulsators.},

	abstract = {The intermediate period gap, discovered by Kepler, is an observed dearth of stellar rotation periods in the temperature-period diagram at {\textasciitilde}20 days for G dwarfs and up to {\textasciitilde}30 days for early-M dwarfs. However, because Kepler mainly targeted solar-like stars, there is a lack of measured periods for M dwarfs, especially those at the fully convective limit. Therefore it is unclear if the intermediate period gap exists for mid- to late-M dwarfs. Here, we present a period catalog containing 40,553 rotation periods (9535 periods {\textgreater}10 days), measured using the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). To measure these periods, we developed a simple pipeline that improves directly on the ZTF archival light curves and reduces the photometric scatter by 26\%, on average. This new catalog spans a range of stellar temperatures that connect samples from Kepler with MEarth, a ground-based time-domain survey of bright M dwarfs, and reveals that the intermediate period gap closes at the theoretically predicted location of the fully convective boundary (G BP - G RP {\textasciitilde} 2.45 mag). This result supports the hypothesis that the gap is caused by core-envelope interactions. Using gyro-kinematic ages, we also find a potential rapid spin-down of stars across this period gap.},

Here, we develop and test a hierarchical probabilistic method for performing the relevant meta-analysis, that is, inferring the true eccentricity distribution, taking as input the likelihood functions for the individual star eccentricities, or samplings of the posterior probability distributions for the eccentricities (under a given, uninformative prior). The method is a simple implementation of a hierarchical Bayesian model; it can also be seen as a kind of heteroscedastic deconvolution. It can be applied to any quantity measured with finite precision—other orbital parameters, or indeed any astronomical measurements of any kind, including magnitudes, distances, or photometric redshifts—so long as the measurements have been communicated as a likelihood function or a posterior sampling.},

Our automated autocorrelation-based method detected rotation periods between 0.2 and 70 days for 34,030 (25.6\%) of the 133,030 main-sequence Kepler targets (excluding known eclipsing binaries and Kepler Objects of Interest), making this the largest sample of stellar rotation periods to date. In this paper we consider the detailed features of the now well-populated period–temperature distribution and demonstrate that the period bimodality, first seen by McQuillan et al. in the M-dwarf sample, persists to higher masses, becoming less visible above 0.6 M☉. We show that these results are globally consistent with the existing ground-based rotation-period data and find that the upper envelope of the period distribution is broadly consistent with a gyrochronological age of 4.5 Gyr, based on the isochrones of Barnes, Mamajek, \& Hillenbrand and Meibom et al. We also performed a detailed comparison of our results to those of Reinhold et al. and Nielsen et al., who measured rotation periods of field stars observed by Kepler. We examined the amplitude of periodic variability for the stars with detection rotation periods, and found a typical range between ∼950 ppm (5th percentile) and ∼22,700 ppm (95th percentile), with a median of ∼5600 ppm. We found typically higher amplitudes for shorter periods and lower effective temperatures, with an excess of low-amplitude stars above ∼5400 K.},

	abstract = {We use N-body simulations to investigate the structure of dark halos in the standard cold dark matter cosmogony. Halos are excised from simulations of cosmologically representative regions and are resimulated individually at high resolution. We study objects with masses ranging from those of dwarf galaxy halos to those of rich galaxy clusters. The spherically averaged density profiles of all our halos can be fitted over two decades in radius by scaling a simple "universal" profile. The characteristic over- density of a halo, or equivalently its concentration, correlates strongly with halo mass in a way that reflects the mass dependence of the epoch of halo formation. Halo profiles are approximately isothermal over a large range in radii but are significantly shallower than r -2 near the center and steeper than r-2 near the virial radius. Matching the observed rotation curves of disk galaxies requires disk mass-to-light ratios to increase systematically with luminosity. Further, it suggests that the halos of bright galaxies depend only weakly on galaxy luminosity and have circular velocities significantly lower than the disk rotation speed. This may explain why luminosity and dynamics are uncorrelated in observed samples of binary galaxies and of satellite/spiral systems. For galaxy clusters, our halo models are consistent both with the presence of giant arcs and with the observed structure of the intracluster medium, and they suggest a simple explanation for the disparate estimates of cluster core radii found by previous authors. Our results also highlight two shortcomings of the CDM model. CDM halos are too concentrated to be consistent with the halo parameters inferred for dwarf irregulars, and the predicted abundance of galaxy halos is larger than the observed abundance of galaxies. The first problem may imply that the core structure of dwarf galaxies was altered by the galaxy formation process, and the second problem may imply that galaxies failed to form (or remain undetected) in many dark halos.},

Our data include evolutionary state, surface gravity, mean density, mass, radius, age, and the spectroscopic and asteroseismic measurements used to derive them. We employ a new empirical approach for combining asteroseismic measurements from different methods, calibrating the inferred stellar parameters, and estimating uncertainties. With high statistical significance, we find that asteroseismic parameters inferred from the different pipelines have systematic offsets that are not removed by accounting for differences in their solar reference values. We include theoretically motivated corrections to the large frequency spacing (Δν) scaling relation, and we calibrate the zero-point of the frequency of the maximum power (νmax) relation to be consistent with masses and radii for members of star clusters. For most targets, the parameters returned by different pipelines are in much better agreement than would be expected from the pipeline-predicted random errors, but 22\% of them had at least one method not return a result and a much larger measurement dispersion. This supports the usage of multiple analysis techniques for asteroseismic stellar population studies. The measured dispersion in mass estimates for fundamental calibrators is consistent with our error model, which yields median random and systematic mass uncertainties for RGB stars of order 4\%. Median random and systematic mass uncertainties are at the 9\% and 8\% level, respectively, for red clump stars.},

	abstract = {We employ high-resolution N-body simulations of isolated spiral galaxy models, from low-amplitude, multi-armed galaxies to Milky Way-like disks, to estimate the vertical action of ensembles of stars in an axisymmetric potential. In the multi-armed galaxy the low-amplitude arms represent tiny perturbations of the potential, hence the vertical action for a set of stars is conserved, although after several orbital periods of revolution the conservation degrades significantly. For a Milky Way-like galaxy with vigorous spiral activity and the formation of a bar, our results show that the potential is far from steady, implying that the action is not a constant of motion. Furthermore, because of the presence of high-amplitude arms and the bar, considerable in-plane and vertical heating occurs that forces stars to deviate from near-circular orbits, reducing the degree at which the actions are conserved for individual stars, in agreement with previous results, but also for ensembles of stars. If confirmed, this result has several implications, including the assertion that the thick disk of our Galaxy forms by radial migration of stars, under the assumption of the conservation of the action describing the vertical motion of stars.},

The synergy between {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} astrometry, photometry, and spectroscopic surveys gives us comprehensive information about the Milky Way. Using the Bayesian isochrone-fitting code StarHorse, we derive distances and extinctions for more than 10 million unique stars listed in both {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} Data Release 3 and public spectroscopic surveys: 557 559 in GALAH+ DR3, 4 531 028 in LAMOST DR7 LRS, 347 535 in LAMOST DR7 MRS, 562 424 in APOGEE DR17, 471 490 in RAVE DR6, 249 991 in SDSS DR12 (optical spectra from BOSS and SEGUE), 67 562 in the {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater}-ESO DR5 survey, and 4 211 087 in the {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} RVS part of the {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} DR3 release. StarHorse can increase the precision of distance and extinction measurements where {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} parallaxes alone would be uncertain. We used StarHorse for the first time to derive stellar ages for main-sequence turnoff and subgiant branch stars, around 2.5 million stars, with age uncertainties typically around 30\%; the uncertainties drop to 15\% for subgiant-branch-only stars, depending on the resolution of the survey. With the derived ages in hand, we investigated the chemical-age relations. In particular, the {\textless}i{\textgreater}α{\textless}i/{\textgreater} and neutron-capture element ratios versus age in the solar neighbourhood show trends similar to previous works, validating our ages. We used the chemical abundances from local subgiant samples of GALAH DR3, APOGEE DR17, and LAMOST MRS DR7 to map groups with similar chemical compositions and StarHorse ages, using the dimensionality reduction technique t-SNE and the clustering algorithm HDBSCAN. We identify three distinct groups in all three samples, confirmed by their kinematic properties: the genuine chemical thick disk, the thin disk, and a considerable number of young alpha-rich stars (427) that are also a part of the delivered catalogues. We confirm that the genuine thick disk’s kinematics and age properties are radically different from those of the thin disk and compatible with high-redshift ({\textless}i{\textgreater}z{\textless}i/{\textgreater} ≈ 2) star-forming disks with high dispersion velocities. We also find a few extra chemical populations in GALAH DR3 thanks to the availability of neutron-capture element information.},

	abstract = {Context. The CARMENES instrument, installed at the 3.5 m telescope of the Calar Alto Observatory in Almería, Spain, was conceived to deliver high-accuracy radial velocity (RV) measurements with long-term stability to search for temperate rocky planets around a sample of nearby cool stars. Moreover, the broad wavelength coverage was designed to provide a range of stellar activity indicators to assess the nature of potential RV signals and to provide valuable spectral information to help characterise the stellar targets. Aims: We describe the CARMENES guaranteed time observations (GTO), spanning from 2016 to 2020, during which 19 633 spectra for a sample of 362 targets were collected. We present the CARMENES Data Release 1 (DR1), which makes public all observations obtained during the GTO of the CARMENES survey. Methods: The CARMENES survey target selection was aimed at minimising biases, and about 70\% of all known M dwarfs within 10 pc and accessible from Calar Alto were included. The data were pipeline-processed, and high-level data products, including 18 642 precise RVs for 345 targets, were derived. Time series data of spectroscopic activity indicators were also obtained. Results: We discuss the characteristics of the CARMENES data, the statistical properties of the stellar sample, and the spectroscopic measurements. We show examples of the use of CARMENES data and provide a contextual view of the exoplanet population revealed by the survey, including 33 new planets, 17 re-analysed planets, and 26 confirmed planets from transiting candidate follow-up. A subsample of 238 targets was used to derive updated planet occurrence rates, yielding an overall average of 1.44 ± 0.20 planets with 1 M⊕ {\textless} Mpl sin i {\textless} 1000 M⊕ and 1 day {\textless} Porb {\textless} 1000 days per star, and indicating that nearly every M dwarf hosts at least one planet. All the DR1 raw data, pipeline-processed data, and high-level data products are publicly available online. Conclusions: CARMENES data have proven very useful for identifying and measuring planetary companions. They are also suitable for a variety of additional applications, such as the determination of stellar fundamental and atmospheric properties, the characterisation of stellar activity, and the study of exoplanet atmospheres.

We use both controlled simulations in which only a single spiral mode is excited, as well as slightly more realistic cases with multiple spiral patterns and a bar. We ﬁnd that rms angular momentum changes are reduced by vertical motion, but rather gradually, and the maximum changes are almost as large for thick disc stars as for those in a thin disc. We ﬁnd that particles in simulations in which a bar forms suffer slightly larger angular momentum changes than in comparable cases with no bar, but the cumulative effect of multiple spiral events still dominates. We have determined that vertical action, and not vertical energy, is conserved on average during radial migration.},

	abstract = {The Milky Way has distinct structural stellar components linked to its formation and subsequent evolution, but disentangling them is non-trivial. With the recent availability of high-quality data for a large numbers of stars in the Milky Way, it is a natural next step for research in the evolution of the Galaxy to perform automated explorations with unsupervised methods of the structures hidden in the combination of large-scale spectroscopic, astrometric, and asteroseismic data sets. We determine precise stellar properties for 21 076 red giants, mainly spanning 2–15 kpc in Galactocentric radii, making it the largest sample of red giants with measured asteroseismic ages available to date. We explore the nature of different stellar structures in the Galactic disc by using Gaussian mixture models as an unsupervised clustering method to find substructure in the combined chemical, kinematic, and age subspace. The best-fitting mixture model yields four distinct physical Galactic components in the stellar disc: the thin disc, the kinematically heated thin disc, the thick disc, and the stellar halo. We find hints of an age asymmetry between the Northern and Southern hemisphere, and we measure the vertical and radial age gradient of the Galactic disc using the asteroseismic ages extended to further distances than previous studies.},

	abstract = {I describe the design, implementation, and usage of galpy, a python package for galactic-dynamics calculations. At its core, galpy consists of a general framework for representing galactic potentials both in python and in C (for accelerated computations); galpy functions, objects, and methods can generally take arbitrary combinations of these as arguments. Numerical orbit integration is supported with a variety of Runge–Kutta-type and symplectic integrators. For planar orbits, integration of the phase-space volume is also possible. galpy supports the calculation of action–angle coordinates and orbital frequencies for a given phase-space point for general spherical potentials, using state-of-the-art numerical approximations for axisymmetric potentials, and making use of a recent general approximation for any static potential. A number of different distribution functions (DFs) are also included in the current release; currently, these consist of two-dimensional axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric disk DFs, a three-dimensional disk DF, and a DF framework for tidal streams. I provide several examples to illustrate the use of the code. I present a simple model for the Milky Way's gravitational potential consistent with the latest observations. I also numerically calculate the Oort functions for different tracer populations of stars and compare them to a new analytical approximation. Additionally, I characterize the response of a kinematically warm disk to an elliptical m = 2 perturbation in detail. Overall, galpy consists of about 54,000 lines, including 23,000 lines of code in the module, 11,000 lines of test code, and about 20,000 lines of documentation. The test suite covers 99.6\% of the code. galpy is available at http://github.com/jobovy/galpy with extensive documentation available at http://galpy.readthedocs.org/en/latest.},

Instead of using \${\textbackslash}textit\{ab initio\}\$ stellar models, we develop a data-driven model of \${\textbackslash}textit\{Gaia\}\$ XP spectra as a function of the stellar parameters, with a few straightforward built-in physical assumptions. We train our model on stellar atmospheric parameters from the LAMOST survey, which provides broad coverage of different spectral types. We model the \${\textbackslash}textit\{Gaia\}\$ XP spectra with all of their covariances, augmented by 2MASS and WISE photometry that greatly reduces degeneracies between stellar parameters, yielding more precise determinations of temperature and dust reddening. Taken together, our approach overcomes a number of important limitations that the astrophysical parameters released in \${\textbackslash}textit\{Gaia\}\$ DR3 faced, and exploits the full information content of the data. We provide the resulting catalog of stellar atmospheric parameters, revised parallaxes and extinction estimates, with all their uncertainties. The modeling procedure also produces an estimate of the optical extinction curve at the spectral resolution of the XP spectra (\$R {\textbackslash}sim 20-100\$), which agrees reasonably well with the \$\{R(V) = 3.1\}\$ CCM model. Remaining limitations that will be addressed in future work are that the model assumes a universal extinction law, ignores binary stars and does not cover all parts of the Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram (\${\textbackslash}textit\{e.g.\}\$, white dwarfs).},

	abstract = {Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that avoids the random walk behavior and sensitivity to correlated parameters that plague many MCMC methods by taking a series of steps informed by first-order gradient information. These features allow it to converge to high-dimensional target distributions much more quickly than simpler methods such as random walk Metropolis or Gibbs sampling. However, HMC's performance is highly sensitive to two user-specified parameters: a step size ε and a desired number of steps L. In particular, if L is too small then the algorithm exhibits undesirable random walk behavior, while if L is too large the algorithm wastes computation. We introduce the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), an extension to HMC that eliminates the need to set a number of steps L. NUTS uses a recursive algorithm to build a set of likely candidate points that spans a wide swath of the target distribution, stopping automatically when it starts to double back and retrace its steps. Empirically, NUTS performs at least as efficiently as (and sometimes more effciently than) a well tuned standard HMC method, without requiring user intervention or costly tuning runs. We also derive a method for adapting the step size parameter ε on the fly based on primal-dual averaging. NUTS can thus be used with no hand-tuning at all, making it suitable for applications such as BUGS-style automatic inference engines that require efficient "turnkey" samplers.},

The fraction of binary stars ranges from ∼15\% to more than ∼60\% without significant correlation with the mass and the age of the host cluster. Moreover, we detect hints of a correlation between the total fraction of binary stars and the central density of the host cluster. We compared the fraction of binary stars with that of BSSs, finding that clusters with high and low central density exhibit different trends. The fraction of binaries does not significantly change with the mass of the primary star and the mass ratio. The radial distribution of binary stars depends on cluster age. The binaries of clusters younger than ∼800 Myr typically show a flat radial distribution, with some hints of a double peak. In contrast, the binaries of the remaining clusters are more centrally concentrated than the single stars, which is similar to what is observed in globular clusters.},

	abstract = {Planet formation is generally described in terms of a system containing the host star and a protoplanetary disk1–3, of which the internal properties (for example, mass and metallicity) determine the properties of the resulting planetary system4. However, (proto)planetary systems are predicted5,6 and observed7,8 to be affected by the spatially clustered stellar formation environment, through either dynamical star–star interactions or external photoevaporation by nearby massive stars9. It is challenging to quantify how the architecture of planetary sysems is affected by these environmental processes, because stellar groups spatially disperse within less than a billion years10, well below the ages of most known exoplanets. Here we identify old, co-moving stellar groups around exoplanet host stars in the astrometric data from the Gaia satellite11,12 and demonstrate that the architecture of planetary systems exhibits a strong dependence on local stellar clustering in position-velocity phase space. After controlling for host stellar age, mass, metallicity and distance from the star, we obtain highly significant differences (with p values of 10−5 to 10−2) in planetary system properties between phase space overdensities (composed of a greater number of co-moving stars than unstructured space) and the field. The median semi-major axis and orbital period of planets in phase space overdensities are 0.087 astronomical units and 9.6 days, respectively, compared to 0.81 astronomical units and 154 days, respectively, for planets around field stars. ‘Hot Jupiters’ (massive, short-period exoplanets) predominantly exist in stellar phase space overdensities, strongly suggesting that their extreme orbits originate from environmental perturbations rather than internal migration13,14 or planet–planet scattering15,16. Our findings reveal that stellar clustering is a key factor setting the architectures of planetary systems.},

However, the utility of an open cluster can be limited by the accuracy and completeness of its known members. Here, we employ a “top-down” technique, Extreme Deconvolution Gaussian Mixture Models (XDGMMs), to extract and evaluate known open clusters from Gaia DR2 by fitting the distribution of stellar parallax and proper motion along a line of sight. Extreme deconvolution techniques can recover the intrinsic distribution of astrometric quantities, accounting for the full covariance matrix of the errors; this allows open cluster members to be identified even when presented with relatively uncertain measurement data. To date, open cluster studies have only applied extreme deconvolution to specialized searches for individual systems. We use XDGMMs to characterize the open clusters reported by Ahumada \& Lapasset and are able to recover 420 of the 426 open clusters therein (98.1\%). Our membership list contains the overwhelming majority ({\textgreater}95\%) of previously known cluster members. We also identify a new, significant, and relatively faint cluster member population and validate their membership status using Gaia eDR3. We report the fortuitous discovery of 11 new open cluster candidates within the lines of sight we analyzed. We present our technique, as well as its advantages and challenges, and publish our membership lists and updated cluster parameters.},

We used published membership probability of the stars derived from Gaia DR2 data and applied our isochrone fitting code, updated as in Monteiro et al. (2020), to GBP and GRPGaia DR2 data for member stars. In doing this, we take into account the nominal errors in the data and derive distance, age, and extinction of each cluster. This work therefore provides parameters for 1743 open clusters and, as a by-product, a list of likely not physical or dubious open clusters is provided as well for future investigations. Furthermore, it was possible to estimate the mean radial velocity of 831 clusters (198 of which are new and unpublished so far), using stellar radial velocities from Gaia DR2 catalogue. By comparing the open cluster distances obtained from isochrone fitting with those obtained from a maximum likelihood estimate of individual member parallaxes, we found a systematic offset of (−0.05 ± 0.04) mas.},

Characterizing the kinematic properties (e.g., Galactic component membership and kinematic age) of these Kepler targets (including the planet candidate hosts) is the first step toward studying Kepler planets in the Galactic context, which will reveal fresh insights into planet formation and evolution. In this paper, the second part of the Planets Across the Space and Time (PAST) series, by combining the data from the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) and Gaia and then applying the revised kinematic methods from PAST I, we present a catalog of kinematic properties (i.e., Galactic positions, velocities, and the relative membership probabilities among the thin disk, thick disk, Hercules stream, and the halo) as well as other basic stellar parameters for 35,835 Kepler stars. Further analyses of the LAMOST–Gaia–Kepler catalog demonstrate that our derived kinematic age reveals the expected stellar activity-age trend. Furthermore, we find that the fraction of thin (thick) disk stars increases (decreases) with the transiting planet multiplicity (N p = 0, 1, 2 and 3+) and the kinematic age decreases with N p, which could be a consequence of the dynamical evolution of planetary architecture with age. The LAMOST–Gaia–Kepler catalog will be useful for future studies on the correlations between the exoplanet distributions and the stellar Galactic environments as well as ages.},

The relations between the characteristics of these planetary systems and the kinematics, Galactic components, and ages of their host stars have yet to be well explored. To address these questions, we conduct a research project, dubbed Planets Across Space and Time (PAST). To do this, one of the key steps is to accurately characterize the planet host stars. In this paper, Paper I of the PAST series, we revisit the kinematic method for classification of Galactic components and extend the applicable range of velocity ellipsoid from ∼100 pc to ∼1500 pc from the Sun in order to cover most known planet hosts. Furthermore, we revisit the age–velocity dispersion relation (AVR), which allows us to derive kinematic ages with a typical uncertainty of 10–20\% for an ensemble of stars. Applying the above revised methods, we present a catalog of kinematic properties (i.e., Galactic positions, velocities, and the relative membership probabilities among the thin disk, thick disk, Hercules stream, and the halo) as well as other basic stellar parameters for 2174 host stars of 2872 planets by combining data from Gaia, LAMOST, APOGEE, RAVE, and the NASA exoplanet archive.

	abstract = {The planetary systems detected so far exhibit a wide diversity of architectures, and various methods have been proposed to quantitatively study this diversity. Straightforward ways to quantify the difference between two systems, and more generally two sets of multi-planetary systems, are helpful for studying this diversity. In this work we present a novel approach, using a weighted extension of the energy distance (WED) metric, to quantify the difference between planetary systems on the logarithmic period-radius plane. We demonstrate the use of this metric and its relation to previously introduced descriptive measures to characterise the arrangements of {\textless}i{\textgreater}Kepler{\textless}i/{\textgreater} planetary systems. By applying exploratory machine-learning tools, we attempt to find whether there is some order that can be ascribed to the set of multi-planet {\textless}i{\textgreater}Kepler{\textless}i/{\textgreater} system architectures. Based on the WED, the ‘Sequencer’, which is such an automatic tool, identifies a progression from small and compact planetary systems to systems with distant giant planets. It is reassuring to see that a WED-based tool does indeed identify this progression. Next, we extend the WED to define the inter-catalogue energy distance – a distance metric between sets of multi-planetary systems. We have made the specific implementation presented in the paper available to the community through a public repository. We suggest using these metrics as complementary tools in attempts to compare different architectures of planetary systems and, in general, different catalogues of planetary systems.},

	abstract = {Depending on the stellar densities, protoplanetary discs in stellar clusters undergo: background heating; disc truncation-driven by stellar encounter; and photoevaporation. Disc truncation leads to reduced characteristic sizes and disc masses that eventually halt gas giant planet formation. We investigate how disc truncation impacts planet formation via pebble-based core accretion paradigm, where pebble sizes were derived from the full grain-size distribution within the disc lifetimes. We make the best-case assumption of one embryo and one stellar encounter per disc. Using planet population synthesis techniques, we find that disc truncation shifts the disc mass distributions to the lower margins. This consequently lowered the gas giant occurrence rates. Despite the reduced gas giant formation rates in clustered discs, the encounter models mostly show as in the isolated field; the cold Jupiters are more frequent than the hot Jupiters, consistent with observation. Moreover, the ratio of hot to cold Jupiters depend on the periastron distribution of the perturbers with linear distribution in periastron ratio showing enhanced hot to cold Jupiters ratio in comparison to the remaining models. Our results are valid in the best-case scenario corresponding to our assumptions of: only one disc encounter with a perturber, ambient background heating, and less rampant photoevaporation. It is not known exactly of how much gas giant planet formation would be affected should disc encounter, background heating, and photoevaporation act in a concert. Thus, our study will hopefully serve as motivation for quantitative investigations of the detailed impact of stellar cluster environments on planet formations.},

In order to place planet formation in the context of Galactic chemical evolution, we made use of a large ({\textless}i{\textgreater}N{\textless}i/{\textgreater} = 5325) stellar sample representing the thin and thick discs, defined chemically, and the halo, and we simulated planet formation by pebble accretion around these stars. We built a chemical model of their protoplanetary discs, taking into account the relevant chemical transitions between vapour and refractory minerals, in order to track the resulting compositions of formed planets. We find that the masses of our synthetic planets increase on average with increasing stellar metallicity [Fe/H] and that giant planets and super-Earths are most common around thin-disc ({\textless}i{\textgreater}α{\textless}i/{\textgreater}-poor) stars since these stars have an overall higher budget of solid particles. Giant planets are found to be very rare (≲1\%) around thick-disc ({\textless}i{\textgreater}α{\textless}i/{\textgreater}-rich) stars and nearly non-existent around halo stars. This indicates that the planet population is more diverse for more metal-rich stars in the thin disc. Water-rich planets are less common around low-metallicity stars since their low metallicity prohibits efficient growth beyond the water ice line. If we allow water to oxidise iron in the protoplanetary disc, this results in decreasing core mass fractions with increasing [Fe/H]. Excluding iron oxidation from our condensation model instead results in higher core mass fractions, in better agreement with the core-mass fraction of Earth, that increase with increasing [Fe/H]. Our work demonstrates how the Galactic chemical evolution and stellar parameters, such as stellar mass and chemical composition, can shape the resulting planet population.},

With the wide variety of multiobject spectrographs currently in operation and becoming available soon, we require easily generalizable methods for determining the selection functions of these surveys. Previous work, however, has largely been focused on generating individual, tailored selection functions for every data release of each survey. Moreover, no methods for combining these selection functions to be used for joint catalogues have been developed.We have developed a Poisson likelihood estimation method for calculating selection functions in a Bayesian framework, which can be generalized to any multiobject spectrograph. We include a robust treatment of overlapping fields within a survey as well as selection functions for combined samples with overlapping footprints. We also provide a method for transforming the selection function that depends on the sky positions, colour, and apparent magnitude of a star to one that depends on the galactic location, metallicity, mass, and age of a star. This ‘intrinsic’ selection function is invaluable for chemodynamical models of the Milky Way. We demonstrate that our method is successful at recreating synthetic spectroscopic samples selected from a mock galaxy catalogue.},

Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) is a suite of open source, robust, efficient, thread-safe libraries for a wide range of applications in computational stellar astrophysics. A one-dimensional stellar evolution module, MESAstar, combines many of the numerical and physics modules for simulations of a wide range of stellar evolution scenarios ranging from very low mass to massive stars, including advanced evolutionary phases. MESAstar solves the fully coupled structure and composition equations simultaneously. It uses adaptive mesh refinement and sophisticated timestep controls, and supports shared memory parallelism based on OpenMP. State-of-the-art modules provide equation of state, opacity, nuclear reaction rates, element diffusion data, and atmosphere boundary conditions. Each module is constructed as a separate Fortran 95 library with its own explicitly defined public interface to facilitate independent development. Several detailed examples indicate the extensive verification and testing that is continuously performed and demonstrate the wide range of capabilities that MESA possesses. These examples include evolutionary tracks of very low mass stars, brown dwarfs, and gas giant planets to very old ages; the complete evolutionary track of a 1 M☉ star from the pre-main sequence (PMS) to a cooling white dwarf; the solar sound speed profile; the evolution of intermediate-mass stars through the He-core burning phase and thermal pulses on the He-shell burning asymptotic giant branch phase; the interior structure of slowly pulsating B Stars and Beta Cepheids; the complete evolutionary tracks of massive stars from the PMS to the onset of core collapse; mass transfer from stars undergoing Roche lobe overflow; and the evolution of helium accretion onto a neutron star.

Improvements in MESAstar's ability to model the evolution of giant planets now extends its applicability down to masses as low as one-tenth that of Jupiter. The dramatic improvement in asteroseismology enabled by the space-based Kepler and CoRoT missions motivates our full coupling of the ADIPLS adiabatic pulsation code with MESAstar. This also motivates a numerical recasting of the Ledoux criterion that is more easily implemented when many nuclei are present at non-negligible abundances. This impacts the way in which MESAstar calculates semi-convective and thermohaline mixing. We exhibit the evolution of 3–8 M☉ stars through the end of core He burning, the onset of He thermal pulses, and arrival on the white dwarf cooling sequence. We implement diffusion of angular momentum and chemical abundances that enable calculations of rotating-star models, which we compare thoroughly with earlier work. We introduce a new treatment of radiation-dominated envelopes that allows the uninterrupted evolution of massive stars to core collapse. This enables the generation of new sets of supernovae, long gamma-ray burst, and pair-instability progenitor models. We substantially modify the way in which MESAstar solves the fully coupled stellar structure and composition equations, and we show how this has improved the scaling of MESA's calculational speed on multi-core processors. Updates to the modules for equation of state, opacity, nuclear reaction rates, and atmospheric boundary conditions are also provided.

	abstract = {In this study, we performed a homogeneous analysis of the planets around FGK dwarf stars observed by the Kepler and K2 missions, providing spectroscopic parameters for 310 K2 targets —including 239 Scaling K2 hosts—observed with Keck/HIRES. For orbital periods less than 40 days, we found that the distribution of planets as a function of orbital period, stellar effective temperature, and metallicity was consistent between K2 and Kepler, reflecting consistent planet formation efficiency across numerous ∼1 kpc sight-lines in the local Milky Way. Additionally, we detected a 3× excess of sub-Saturns relative to warm Jupiters beyond 10 days, suggesting a closer association between sub-Saturn and sub-Neptune formation than between sub-Saturn and Jovian formation. Performing a joint analysis of Kepler and K2 demographics, we observed diminishing super-Earth, sub-Neptune, and sub-Saturn populations at higher stellar effective temperatures, implying an inverse relationship between formation and disk mass. In contrast, no apparent host-star spectral-type dependence was identified for our population of Jupiters, which indicates gas-giant formation saturates within the FGK mass regimes. We present support for stellar metallicity trends reported by previous Kepler analyses. Using Gaia DR3 proper motion and radial velocity measurements, we discovered a galactic location trend; stars that make large vertical excursions from the plane of the Milky Way host fewer super-Earths and sub-Neptunes. While oscillation amplitude is associated with metallicity, metallicity alone cannot explain the observed trend, demonstrating that galactic influences are imprinted on the planet population. Overall, our results provide new insights into the distribution of planets around FGK dwarf stars and the factors that influence their formation and evolution.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we investigate some chemokinematical properties of the Milky Way disk, by using a sample composed by 424 late-type dwarfs. We show that the velocity dispersion of a stellar group correlates with the age of this group, according to a law proportional to t0.26, where t is the age of the stellar group. The temporal evolution of the vertex deviation is considered in detail. It is shown that the vertex deviation does not seem to depend strongly on the age of the stellar group. Previous studies in the literature seem to not have found it due to the use of statistical ages for stellar groups, rather than individual ages. The possibility to use the orbital parameters of a star to derive information about its birthplace is investigated, and we show that the mean galactocentric radius is likely to be the most reliable stellar birthplace indicator. However, this information cannot be presently used to derive radial evolutionary constraints, due to an intrinsic bias present in all samples constructed from nearby stars. An extensive discussion of the secular and stochastic heating mechanisms commonly invoked to explain the age-velocity dispersion relation is presented. We suggest that the age-velocity dispersion relation could reflect the gradual decrease in the turbulent velocity dispersion from which disk stars form, a suggestion originally made by Tinsley \& Larson ({\textbackslash}cite\{tinsley\}, ApJ, 221, 554) and supported by several more recent disk evolution calculations. A test to distinguish between the two types of models using high-redshift galaxies is proposed.

We exploit an empirically calibrated method to estimate spectroscopic effective temperature (T eff) and the Stefan–Boltzmann law to determine radii of 183 nearby K7–M7 single stars with a precision of 2\%–5\%. Our improved stellar parameters enable us to develop model-independent relations between T eff or absolute magnitude and radius, as well as between color and T eff. The derived T eff–radius relation depends strongly on [Fe/H], as predicted by theory. The relation between absolute K S magnitude and radius can predict radii accurate to 3\%. We derive bolometric corrections to the and Gaia passbands as a function of color, accurate to 1\%–3\%. We confront the reliability of predictions from Dartmouth stellar evolution models using a Markov chain Monte Carlo to find the values of unobservable model parameters (mass, age) that best reproduce the observed effective temperature and bolometric flux while satisfying constraints on distance and metallicity as Bayesian priors. With the inferred masses we derive a semi-empirical mass–absolute magnitude relation with a scatter of 2\% in mass. The best-agreement models overpredict stellar T eff values by an average of 2.2\% and underpredict stellar radii by 4.6\%, similar to differences with values from low-mass eclipsing binaries. These differences are not correlated with metallicity, mass, or indicators of activity, suggesting issues with the underlying model assumptions, e.g., opacities or convective mixing length.},

The ages and masses are determined by matching with stellar isochrones using a Bayesian algorithm, utilizing effective temperature , absolute magnitude , metallicity [Fe/H], and α-element to iron abundance ratio [α/Fe] deduced from the LAMOST spectra. Extensive examinations suggest the age and mass estimates are robust. Overall, the sample stars have a median error of 34\% for the age estimates, and half of the stars older than 2 Gyr have age uncertainties of only 20\%–30\%. The median error for the mass estimates of the whole sample of stars is ∼8\%. The huge data set demonstrates good correlations among stellar age, [Fe/H] ([α/H]), and [α/Fe]. Particularly, double-sequence features are revealed in both the age–[α/Fe] and age–[Fe/H]([α/H]) spaces. In the [Fe/H]–[α/Fe] space, stars of 8–10 Gyr exhibit both the thin and thick disk sequences, while younger (older) stars show only the thin (thick) disk sequence, indicating that the thin disk became prominent 8–10 Gyr ago, while the thick disk formed earlier and was almost quenched 8 Gyr ago. Stellar ages exhibit positive vertical and negative radial gradients across the disk, and the outer disk of R ≳ 9 kpc exhibits a strong flare in stellar age distribution.},

The sample used in this work comes from the Geneva-Copenhagen Survey (GCS) that contains the spatial velocities, orbital eccentricities, and isochronal ages for about 14 000 stars. Using the GCS stars, we fitted the parameters that describe the relations between the distributions of kinematical properties and age. This parametrization allows us to obtain an age probability from the kinematical data. From this age PDF, we estimate an individual average age for the star using the most likely age and the expected age. We have obtained the stellar age PDF for the age of 9102 stars from the GCS and have shown that the distribution of individual ages derived from our method is in good agreement with the distribution of isochronal ages. We also observe a decline in the mean metallicity with our ages for stars younger than 7 Gyr, similar to the one observed for isochronal ages. This method can be useful for the estimation of rough stellar ages for those stars that fall in areas of the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram where isochrones are tightly crowded. As an example of this method, we estimate the age of Trappist-1, which is a M8V star, obtaining the age of t(UVW) = 12.50(+0.29 - 6.23) Gyr.},

We present the most precise planet size distribution to date based on Gaia parallaxes, Kepler photometry, and spectroscopic temperatures from the California-Kepler Survey. Previously, we measured stellar radii to 11\% precision using high-resolution spectroscopy; by adding Gaia astrometry, the errors are now 3\%. Planet radius measurements are, in turn, improved to 5\% precision. With a catalog of ∼1000 planets with precise properties, we probed in fine detail the gap in the planet size distribution that separates two classes of small planets, rocky super-Earths and gas-dominated sub-Neptunes. Our previous study and others suggested that the gap may be observationally under-resolved and inherently flat-bottomed, with a band of forbidden planet sizes. Analysis based on our new catalog refutes this; the gap is partially filled in. Two other important factors that sculpt the distribution are a planet’s orbital distance and its host-star mass, both of which are related to a planet’s X-ray/UV irradiation history. For lower-mass stars, the bimodal planet distribution shifts to smaller sizes, consistent with smaller stars producing smaller planet cores. Details of the size distribution including the extent of the “sub-Neptune desert” and the width and slope of the gap support the view that photoevaporation of low-density atmospheres is the dominant evolutionary determinant of the planet size distribution.},

	abstract = {The rotational evolution of cool dwarfs is poorly constrained after ∼1–2 Gyr due to a lack of precise ages and rotation periods for old main-sequence stars. In this work, we use velocity dispersion as an age proxy to reveal the temperature-dependent rotational evolution of low-mass Kepler dwarfs and demonstrate that kinematic ages could be a useful tool for calibrating gyrochronology in the future. We ﬁnd that a linear gyrochronology model, calibrated to ﬁt the period–Teff relationship of the Praesepe cluster, does not apply to stars older than around 1 Gyr. Although late K dwarfs spin more slowly than early-K dwarfs when they are young, at old ages, we ﬁnd that late K dwarfs rotate at the same rate or faster than early-K dwarfs of the same age. This result agrees qualitatively with semiempirical models that vary the rate of surface-to-core angular momentum transport as a function of time and mass. It also aligns with recent observations of stars in the NGC 6811 cluster, which indicate that the surface rotation rates of K dwarfs go through an epoch of inhibited evolution. We ﬁnd that the oldest Kepler stars with measured rotation periods are late K and early M dwarfs, indicating that these stars maintain spotted surfaces and stay magnetically active longer than more massive stars. Finally, based on their kinematics, we conﬁrm that many rapidly rotating GKM dwarfs are likely to be synchronized binaries.},

We analyze data and recover rotation rates for 179 of these objects. We add these to rotation rates for members of clusters with known ages (5–700 Myr), as well as objects assumed to have field ages (≳1 Gyr). We use Gaia DR2 parallax and photometry to create color–magnitude diagrams to compare objects across samples. We use color–period plots to analyze the period distributions across age, as well as incorporate Hα equivalent width and tangential velocity where possible to further comment on age dependence. We find that the age of transition from rapid to slow rotation in clusters, which we define as an elbow in the period–color plots, depends on spectral type. Later spectral types transition at older ages: M4 for Praesepe at ≈700 Myr, one of the oldest clusters for which M dwarf rotation rates have been measured. The transition from active to inactive Hα equivalent width also occurs at this elbow, as objects transition from rapid rotation to the slowly rotating sequence. Redder or smaller stars remain active at older ages. Finally, using Gaia kinematics we find evidence for rotation stalling for late Ms in the field sample, suggesting the transition happens much later for mid- to late-type M dwarfs.},

We combined parallax measurements or calculated spectrophotometric distances, and computed tangential velocities for the entire sample. We find that kinematics for the full and volume-limited 20 pc samples are consistent with those expected for the Galactic thin disk, with no significant differences between late-type M, L, and T dwarfs. Applying an age-velocity relation we conclude that the average kinematic age of the 20 pc sample of ultracool dwarfs is older than recent kinematic estimates and more consistent with age results calculated with population synthesis models. There is a statistically distinct population of high tangential velocity sources (V tan {\textgreater} 100 km s-1) whose kinematics suggest an even older population of ultracool dwarfs belonging to either the Galactic thick disk or halo. We isolate subsets of the entire sample, including low surface gravity dwarfs, unusually blue L dwarfs, and photometric outliers in J - Ks color and investigate their kinematics. We find that the spectroscopically distinct class of unusually blue L dwarfs has kinematics clearly consistent with old age, implying that high surface gravity and/or low metallicity may be relevant to their spectral properties. The low surface gravity dwarfs are kinematically younger than the overall population, and the kinematics of the red and blue ultracool dwarfs suggest ages that are younger and older than the full sample, respectively. We also present a reduced proper-motion diagram at 2MASS (Two Micron All Sky Survey) Ks for the entire population and find that a limit of H\_\{K\_\{s\}\} {\textgreater} 18 excludes M dwarfs from the L and T dwarf population regardless of near-infrared color, potentially enabling the identification of the coldest brown dwarfs in the absence of color information.},

In addition, we study magnetic activity as a function of position on the color-magnitude diagram, finding that Hα magnetically active stars have, on average, redder colors and/or brighter magnitudes than inactive stars. This effect cannot be explained by youth alone and might indicate that active stars are magnetically inflated, binaries, and/or high metallicity. Moreover, we find that vertical velocity and vertical action dispersion are correlated with Hα emission, confirming that these two parameters are age indicators.

The analysis resolves long-standing discrepancies between models and data by demonstrating the importance of distinguishing between measured age–velocity dispersion relations (AVRs) and the heating histories of the stars that make up the AVR. We fit both AVRs and heating histories with formulae ∝tβ and determine the exponents βR and βz derived from in-plane and vertical AVRs and \${\textbackslash}tilde\{{\textbackslash}beta \}\_R\$ and \${\textbackslash}tilde\{{\textbackslash}beta \}\_z\$ from heating histories. Values of βz are in almost all simulations larger than values of \${\textbackslash}tilde\{{\textbackslash}beta \}\_z\$, whereas values of βR are similar to or mildly larger than values of \${\textbackslash}tilde\{{\textbackslash}beta \}\_R\$. Moreover, values of βz (\${\textbackslash}tilde\{{\textbackslash}beta \}\_z\$) are generally larger than values of βR (\${\textbackslash}tilde\{{\textbackslash}beta \}\_R\$). The dominant cause of these relations is the decline over the life of the disc in importance of GMCs as heating agents relative to spiral structure and the bar. We examine how age errors and biases in solar neighbourhood surveys influence the measured AVR: they tend to decrease β values by smearing out ages and thus measured dispersions. We compare AVRs and velocity ellipsoid shapes σz/σR from simulations to solar neighbourhood data. We conclude that for the expected disc mass and dark halo structure, combined GMC and spiral/bar heating can explain the AVR of the Galactic thin disc. Strong departures of the disc mass or the dark halo structure from expectation spoil fits to the data.},

We find statistically significant correlation between δADP, N and physical projected distance from the center of the clusters, with the centers appearing smoother than the outskirts, consistent with more rapid dynamical processing on local dynamical, free-fall or orbital timescales. Similarly, smoother distributions are seen in regions of higher surface density, or older dynamical ages. These results indicate that dynamical processing that erases substructure is already well-advanced in young, sometimes still-forming, clusters.

We used isochrone fitting and \$Gaia\$ DR3 photometry, parallaxes, and spectrophotometric metallicities to compute precise, homogeneous \$T\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{eff\}\}\$, \${\textbackslash}log g\$, masses, radii, mean stellar densities, luminosities, ages, distances, and V-band extinctions for 3248, 565, and 4180 \$Kepler\$, \$K2\$, and \$TESS\$ stars, respectively. We compared our stellar properties to studies using fundamental and precise constraints, such as interferometry and asteroseismology, and find residual scatters of 2.8\%, 5.6\%, 5.0\%, and 31\%, with offsets of 0.2\%, 1.0\%, 1.2\%, and 0.7\% between our \$T\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{eff\}\}\$, radii, masses, and ages and those in the literature, respectively. In addition, we compute planet radii, semimajor axes, and incident fluxes for 4281, 676, and 4367 \$Kepler\$, \$K2\$, and \$TESS\$ planets, respectively, and find that the exoplanet radius gap is less prominent in the \$K2\$, \$TESS\$, and combined samples than it is in the \$Kepler\$ sample alone. We suspect this difference is largely due to heterogeneous planet-to-star radius ratios, shorter time baselines of \$K2\$ and \$TESS\$, and smaller sample sizes. Finally, we identify a clear radius inflation trend in our large sample of hot Jupiters and find 150 hot sub-Neptunian desert planets, in addition to a population of over 400 young host stars as potential opportunities for testing theories of planet formation and evolution.},

	abstract = {Kinematic studies of disc galaxies, using individual stars in the Milky Way or statistical studies of global disc kinematics over time, provide insight into how discs form and evolve. We use a high-resolution, cosmological zoom-simulation of a Milky Way-mass disc galaxy (h277) to tie together local disc kinematics and the evolution of the disc over time. The present-day stellar age–velocity relationship (AVR) of h277 is nearly identical to that of the analogous solar-neighbourhood measurement in the Milky Way. A crucial element of this success is the simulation’s dynamically cold multiphase ISM, which allows young stars to form with a low velocity dispersion (σbirth\${\textbackslash}sim {\textbackslash}!6 - 8 {\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}mathrm\{km{\textbackslash}, s\}ˆ\{-1\}\$) at late times. Older stars are born kinematically hotter (i.e. the disc settles over time in an ‘upside-down’ formation scenario), and are subsequently heated after birth. The disc also grows ‘inside-out’, and many of the older stars in the present-day solar neighbourhood are present because of radial mixing. We demonstrate that the evolution of σbirth in h277 can be explained by the same model used to describe the general decrease in velocity dispersion observed in disc galaxies from z ∼ 2–3 to the present-day, in which the disc evolves in quasi-stable equilibrium and the ISM velocity dispersion decreases over time due to a decreasing gas fraction. Thus, our results tie together local observations of the Milky Way’s AVR with observed kinematics of high z disc galaxies.},

This is the first study to make comparisons of properties of galaxies simulated with particle- and grid-based codes. Our analysis indicates that there is broad agreement between these different modelling techniques. We study the velocity dispersion–age relation for disc stars at z= 0 and find that four of the simulations are more consistent with observations by Holmberg, Nordstroem \&amp; Andersen in which the stellar disc appears to undergo continual/secular heating. Two other simulations are in better agreement with the Quillen \&amp; Garnett observations that suggest ‘saturation’ in the heating profile for young stars in the disc. None of the simulations has thin discs as old as that of the Milky Way. We also analyse the kinematics of disc stars at the time of their birth for different epochs in the galaxies’ evolution and find that in some simulations old stars are born cold within the disc and are subsequently heated, while other simulations possess old stellar populations which are born relatively hot. The models which are in better agreement with observations of the Milky Way’s stellar disc undergo significantly lower minor-merger/assembly activity after the last major merger, that is, once the disc has formed. All of the simulations are significantly ‘hotter’ than the Milky Way disc; on top of the effects of mergers, we find a ‘floor’ in the dispersion that is related to the underlying treatment of the heating and cooling of the interstellar medium, and the low density threshold which such codes use for star formation. This finding has important implications for all studies of disc heating that use hydrodynamical codes.},

	abstract = {The velocity dispersion of nearby stars in the Galactic disc is well known to increase substantially with age; this is the so-called age—velocity relation, and is interpreted as a ‘heating’ of the disc as a function of time. We have studied the heating of the Galactic stellar disc caused by giant molecular clouds and halo black holes, via simulations of the orbits of tracer stars embedded in a patch of the local Galactic disc. We examine a range of masses and number densities of the giant molecular cloud and halo black hole perturbers. The heating of the stellar disc in the simulations is fitted with a simple power law of the form σ∝tα, where σ is the velocity dispersion of the tracer stars as a function of time, t. We also fit this form to the best determinations of the increase in the velocity dispersion as a function of time as derived from stars in the solar neighbourhood for which ages can be reliably assigned. Observationally, α is found to lie in the range 0.3–0.6, i.e. it remains poorly constrained and its determination is probably still dominated by systematic errors. Better constrained observationally is the ratio of the velocity dispersions of the stars in the vertical z and horizontal x directions (i.e. towards the Galactic Centre), σz/σx= 0.5 ± 0.1.For the heating of the stellar disc caused by giant molecular clouds (GMCs) we derive a heating σ∝t0.21, which differs somewhat from early (analytic) studies in which σ∝t1/4. This confirms the well-known results that there are insufficient GMCs to heat the Galactic disc appropriately. A range of dark halo black hole scenarios are verified to heat the stellar disc as σ∝t1/2 (as expected from analytical studies), and give σz/σx in the range 0.5–0.6, which is consistent with observations. Black holes with a mass of 107 M⊙ are our favoured disc heaters, although they are only marginally consistent with observations. Simulations featuring a combination of giant molecular clouds and halo black holes can explain the observed heating of the stellar disc, but since other perturbing mechanisms, such as spiral arms, are yet to be included, we regard this solution as being ad hoc.},

	abstract = {We analyze the present day structure and assembly history of a high-resolution hydrodynamic simulation of the formation of a Milky-Way-(MW)-like disk galaxy, from the “Eris” simulation suite, dissecting it into cohorts of stars formed at different epochs of cosmic history. At z = 0, stars with tform {\textless} 2 Gyr mainly occupy the stellar spheroid, with the oldest (earliest forming) stars having more centrally concentrated profiles. The younger age cohorts populate disks of progressively longer radial scale lengths and shorter vertical scale heights. At a given radius, the vertical density profiles and velocity dispersions of stars vary smoothly as a function of age, and the superposition of old, vertically extended and young, vertically compact cohorts gives rise to a double-exponential profile like that observed in the MW. Turning to formation history, we find that the trends of spatial structure and kinematics with stellar age are largely imprinted at birth, or immediately thereafter. Stars that form during the active merger phase at z {\textgreater} 3 are quickly scattered into rounded, kinematically hot configurations. The oldest disk cohorts form in structures that are radially compact and relatively thick, while subsequent cohorts form in progressively larger, thinner, colder configurations from gas with increasing levels of rotational support. The disk thus forms “inside out” in a radial sense and “upside down” in a vertical sense. Secular heating and radial migration influence the final state of each age cohort, but the changes they produce are small compared to the trends established at formation. The predicted correlations of stellar age with spatial and kinematic structure are in good qualitative agreement with the correlations observed for mono-abundance stellar populations in the MW.},

However, it is unclear to what extent each mechanism can generate such a distribution, which is likely to depend on the assembly history of the galaxy. To this end, we perform 16 high-resolution cosmological-zoom simulations of Milky Way-sized galaxies using the state-of-the-art cosmological magnetohydrodynamical code arepo, and analyse the evolution of the vertical kinematics of the stellar disc in connection with various heating mechanisms. We find that the bar is the dominant heating mechanism in most cases, whereas spiral arms, radial migration and adiabatic heating from mid-plane density growth are all subdominant. The strongest source, though less prevalent than bars, originates from external perturbations from satellites/subhaloes of masses log10(M/M⊙) ≳ 10. However, in many simulations the orbits of newborn star particles become cooler with time, such that they dominate the shape of the age–velocity dispersion relation and overall vertical disc structure unless a strong external perturbation takes place.},

As a result of such nonuniform rotation, the clouds will have velocities relative to one another even if their random velocities are zero; the gravitational potential of these clouds will he a fluctuating function of time; and the stars will gain kinetic energy from the clouds. To explain the increase of velocity dispersion with advancing spectral type along the main sequence, the mass of a typical cloud complex must be in the neighborhood of 106m0, the value found previously; but the random velocity of a cloud complex, as a whole, is irrelevant and may be vanishingly small. Since inhomogeneities of density with the required scale of some 300 parsecs or more seem indicated by the extinction observations, it seems not unlikely that star-cloud encounters are, in fact, responsible for the greater velocity dispersion of the later-type, older stars of population type I.},

	abstract = {We study the kinematics of stars both at their formation and today within 14 Milky Way (MW)-mass galaxies from the FIRE-2 cosmological zoom-in simulations. We quantify the relative importance of cosmological disc settling and post-formation dynamical heating. We identify three eras: a Pre-Disc Era (typically ≳ 8 Gyr ago), when stars formed on dispersion-dominated orbits; an Early-Disc Era (≈8–4 Gyr ago), when stars started to form on rotation-dominated orbits but with high velocity dispersion, σform; and a Late-Disc Era (≲ 4 Gyr ago), when stars formed with low σform. σform increased with time during the Pre-Disc Era, peaking ≈8 Gyr ago, then decreased throughout the Early-Disc Era as the disc settled and remained low throughout the Late-Disc Era. By contrast, the dispersion measured today, σnow, increases monotonically with age because of stronger post-formation heating for Pre-Disc stars. Importantly, most of σnow was in place at formation, not added post-formation, for stars younger than ≈10 Gyr. We compare the evolution of the three velocity components: at all times, σR, form \&gt; σϕ, form \&gt; σZ, form. Post-formation heating primarily increased σR at ages ≲ 4 Gyr but acted nearly isotropically for older stars. The kinematics of young stars in FIRE-2 broadly agree with the range observed across the MW, M31, M33, and PHANGS-MUSE galaxies. The lookback time that the disc began to settle correlates with its dynamical state today: earlier-settling galaxies currently form colder discs. Including stellar cosmic-ray feedback does not significantly change disc rotational support at fixed stellar mass.},

We rederive the solar motion and the structure of the local velocity ellipsoids. When the principal velocity dispersions are assumed to increase with time as tβ, the index β is larger for σW (βW≈ 0.45) than for σU (βU≈ 0.31). For the three-dimensional velocity dispersion, we obtain β= 0.35. We exclude saturation of disc heating after ∼3 Gyr as proposed by Quillen \&amp; Garnett. Saturation after ≳4 Gyr combined with an abrupt increase in velocity dispersion for the oldest stars cannot be excluded. For all our models, the star formation rate (SFR) is declining, being a factor of 2–7 lower now than it was at the beginning. Models in which the SFR declines exponentially favour very high disc ages between 11.5 and 13 Gyr and exclude ages below ∼10.5 Gyr as they yield worse fits to the number density and velocity dispersion of red stars. Models in which the SFR is the sum of two declining exponentials representing the thin and thick discs favour ages between 10.5 and 12 Gyr with a lower limit of ∼10.0 Gyr. Although in our models the SFR peaked surprisingly early, the mean formation time of solar-neighbourhood stars is later than in ab initio models of galaxy formation, probably on account of weaknesses in such models.},

	abstract = {The mass–luminosity relation for late-type stars has long been a critical tool for estimating stellar masses. However, there is growing need for both a higher-precision relation and a better understanding of systematic effects (e.g., metallicity). Here we present an empirical relationship between and M* spanning 0.075 M⊙ {\textless} M* {\textless} 0.70 M⊙. The relation is derived from 62 nearby binaries, whose orbits we determine using a combination of Keck/NIRC2 imaging, archival adaptive optics data, and literature astrometry. From their orbital parameters, we determine the total mass of each system, with a precision better than 1\% in the best cases. We use these total masses, in combination with resolved KS magnitudes and system parallaxes, to calibrate the –M* relation. The resulting posteriors can be used to determine masses of single stars with a precision of 2\%–3\%, which we confirm by testing the relation on stars with individual dynamical masses from the literature. The precision is limited by scatter around the best-fit relation beyond measured M* uncertainties, perhaps driven by intrinsic variation in the –M* relation or underestimated uncertainties in the input parallaxes. We find that the effect of [Fe/H] on the –M* relation is likely negligible for metallicities in the solar neighborhood (0.0\% ± 2.2\% change in mass per dex change in [Fe/H]). This weak effect is consistent with predictions from the Dartmouth Stellar Evolution Database, but inconsistent with those from MESA Isochrones and Stellar Tracks (at 5σ). A sample of binaries with a wider range of abundances will be required to discern the importance of metallicity in extreme populations (e.g., in the Galactic halo or thick disk).},

	abstract = {We present interferometric angular diameter measurements of 21 low-mass, K- and M-dwarfs made with the CHARA Array. This sample is enhanced by adding a collection of radius measurements published in the literature to form a total data set of 33 K–M-dwarfs with diameters measured to better than 5\%. We use these data in combination with the Hipparcos parallax and new measurements of the star's bolometric flux to compute absolute luminosities, linear radii, and effective temperatures for the stars. We develop empirical relations for ∼K0 to M4 main-sequence stars that link the stellar temperature, radius, and luminosity to the observed (B − V), (V − R), (V − I), (V − J), (V − H), and (V − K) broadband color index and stellar metallicity [Fe/H]. These relations are valid for metallicities ranging from [Fe/H] = −0.5 to +0.1 dex and are accurate to ∼2\%, ∼5\%, and ∼4\% for temperature, radius, and luminosity, respectively. Our results show that it is necessary to use metallicity-dependent transformations in order to properly convert colors into stellar temperatures, radii, and luminosities. Alternatively, we find no sensitivity to metallicity on relations we construct to the global properties of a star omitting color information, e.g., temperature–radius and temperature–luminosity. Thus, we are able to empirically quantify to what order the star's observed color index is impacted by the stellar iron abundance. In addition to the empirical relations, we also provide a representative look-up table via stellar spectral classifications using this collection of data. Robust examinations of single star temperatures and radii compared to evolutionary model predictions on the luminosity–temperature and luminosity–radius planes reveal that models overestimate the temperatures of stars with surface temperatures {\textless}5000 K by ∼3\%, and underestimate the radii of stars with radii {\textless}0.7 R☉ by ∼5\%. These conclusions additionally suggest that the models over account for the effects that the stellar metallicity may have on the astrophysical properties of an object. By comparing the interferometrically measured radii for the single star population to those of eclipsing binaries, we find that for a given mass, single and binary star radii are indistinguishable. However, we also find that for a given radius, the literature temperatures for binary stars are systematically lower compared to our interferometrically derived temperatures of single stars by ∼200 to 300 K. The nature of this offset is dependent on the validation of binary star temperatures, where bringing all measurements to a uniform and correctly calibrated temperature scale is needed to identify any influence stellar activity may have on the physical properties of a star. Lastly, we present an empirically determined H-R diagram using fundamental properties presented here in combination with those in Boyajian et al. for a total of 74 nearby, main-sequence, A- to M-type stars, and define regions of habitability for the potential existence of sub-stellar mass companions in each system.},

	abstract = {Kepler mission results are rapidly contributing to fundamentally new discoveries in both the exoplanet and asteroseismology fields. The data returned from Kepler are unique in terms of the number of stars observed, precision of photometry for time series observations, and the temporal extent of high duty cycle observations. As the first mission to provide extensive time series measurements on thousands of stars over months to years at a level hitherto possible only for the Sun, the results from Kepler will vastly increase our knowledge of stellar variability for quiet solar-type stars. Here, we report on the stellar noise inferred on the timescale of a few hours of most interest for detection of exoplanets via transits. By design the data from moderately bright Kepler stars are expected to have roughly comparable levels of noise intrinsic to the stars and arising from a combination of fundamental limitations such as Poisson statistics and any instrument noise. The noise levels attained by Kepler on-orbit exceed by some 50\% the target levels for solar-type, quiet stars. We provide a decomposition of observed noise for an ensemble of 12th magnitude stars arising from fundamental terms (Poisson and readout noise), added noise due to the instrument and that intrinsic to the stars. The largest factor in the modestly higher than anticipated noise follows from intrinsic stellar noise. We show that using stellar parameters from galactic stellar synthesis models, and projections to stellar rotation, activity, and hence noise levels reproduce the primary intrinsic stellar noise features.},

	abstract = {Trends in the planet population with host star mass provide an avenue to constrain planet formation theories. We derive the planet radius distribution function for Kepler stars of different spectral types, sampling a range in host star masses. We find that M dwarf stars have 3.5 times more small planets (1.0–2.8 R⨁) than main-sequence FGK stars, but two times fewer Neptune-sized and larger ({\textgreater}2.8 R⨁) planets. We find no systematic trend in the planet size distribution between spectral types F, G, and K to explain the increasing occurrence rates. Taking into account the mass–radius relationship and heavy-element mass of observed exoplanets, and assuming those are independent of spectral type, we derive the inventory of the heavy-element mass locked up in exoplanets at short orbits. The overall higher planet occurrence rates around M stars are not consistent with the redistribution of the same mass into more, smaller planets. At the orbital periods and planet radii where Kepler observations are complete for all spectral types, the average heavy-element mass locked up in exoplanets increases roughly inversely with stellar mass from 4 M⨁ in F stars to 5 M⨁ in G and K stars to 7 M⨁ in M stars. This trend stands in stark contrast with observed protoplanetary disk masses that decrease toward lower mass stars, and provides a challenge for current planet formation models. Neither models of in situ formation nor migration of fully formed planets are consistent with these results. Instead, these results are indicative of large-scale inward migration of planetary building blocks—either through type-I migration or radial drift of dust grains—that is more efficient for lower mass stars, but does not result in significantly larger or smaller planets.},

Our analysis draws on the six-dimensional phase-space coordinates of ≳23,000 luminous red giant stars, for which we previously determined precise parallaxes using a data-driven model that combines spectral data from APOGEE with photometric information from WISE, 2MASS, and Gaia. We derive the circular velocity curve with the Jeans equation assuming an axisymmetric gravitational potential. At the location of the Sun we determine the circular velocity with its formal uncertainty to be = with systematic uncertainties at the ∼2\%–5\% level. We find that the velocity curve is gently but significantly declining at (−1.7 ± 0.1) km s−1 kpc−1, with a systematic uncertainty of 0.46 km s−1 kpc−1, beyond the inner 5 kpc. We exclude the inner 5 kpc from our analysis due to the presence of the Galactic bar, which strongly influences the kinematic structure and requires modeling in a nonaxisymmetric potential.

Similar to the Q1–16 catalog by Huber et al., the classifications are based on conditioning published atmospheric parameters on a grid of Dartmouth isochrones, with significant improvements in the adopted method and over 29,000 new sources for temperatures, surface gravities, or metallicities. In addition to fundamental stellar properties, the new catalog also includes distances and extinctions, and we provide posterior samples for each stellar parameter of each star. Typical uncertainties are ∼27\% in radius, ∼17\% in mass, and ∼51\% in density, which is somewhat smaller than previous catalogs because of the larger number of improved constraints and the inclusion of isochrone weighting when deriving stellar posterior distributions. On average, the catalog includes a significantly larger number of evolved solar-type stars, with an increase of 43.5\% in the number of subgiants.

We describe the construction of the EPIC, as well as modifications and shortcomings of the catalog.

	abstract = {The relationship linking a galaxy cluster’s total mass with the concentration of its mass profile and its redshift is a fundamental prediction of the Cold Dark Matter (CDM) paradigm of cosmic structure formation. However, confronting those predictions with observations is complicated by the fact that simulated clusters are not representative of observed samples where detailed mass profile constraints are possible. In this work, we calculate the symmetry-peakiness-alignment (SPA) morphology metrics for maps of X-ray emissivity from the three hundred project hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy clusters at four redshifts, and thereby select a sample of morphologically relaxed, simulated clusters, using observational criteria. These clusters have on average earlier formation times than the full sample, confirming that they are both morphologically and dynamically more relaxed than typical. We constrain the concentration–mass–redshift relation of both the relaxed and complete sample of simulated clusters, assuming power-law dependences on mass (κm) and 1 + z (κζ), finding κm = −0.12 ± 0.07 and κζ = −0.27 ± 0.19 for the relaxed subsample. From an equivalently selected sample of massive, relaxed clusters observed with Chandra, we find κm = −0.12 ± 0.08 and κζ = −0.48 ± 0.19, in good agreement with the simulation predictions. The simulated and observed samples also agree well on the average concentration at a pivot mass and redshift providing further validation of the ΛCDM paradigm in the properties of the largest gravitationally collapsed structures observed. This also represents the first clear detection of decreasing concentration with redshift, a longstanding prediction of simulations in data.},

	abstract = {{\textless}i{\textgreater}Context.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} We present the third data release of the European Space Agency’s {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} mission, {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} DR3. This release includes a large variety of new data products, notably a much expanded radial velocity survey and a very extensive astrophysical characterisation of {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} sources.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Aims.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} We outline the content and the properties of {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} DR3, providing an overview of the main improvements in the data processing in comparison with previous data releases (where applicable) and a brief discussion of the limitations of the data in this release.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Methods.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} The {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} DR3 catalogue is the outcome of the processing of raw data collected with the {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} instruments during the first 34 months of the mission by the {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} Data Processing and Analysis Consortium.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Results.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} The {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} DR3 catalogue contains the same source list, celestial positions, proper motions, parallaxes, and broad band photometry in the {\textless}i{\textgreater}G{\textless}i/{\textgreater}, {\textless}i{\textgreater}G{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}BP{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}, and {\textless}i{\textgreater}G{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}RP{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} pass-bands already present in the Early Third Data Release, {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} EDR3. {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} DR3 introduces an impressive wealth of new data products. More than 33 million objects in the ranges {\textless}i{\textgreater}G{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}RVS{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} {\textless} 14 and 3100 {\textless} {\textless}i{\textgreater}T{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}eff{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} {\textless} 14 500, have new determinations of their mean radial velocities based on data collected by {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater}. We provide {\textless}i{\textgreater}G{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}RVS{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} magnitudes for most sources with radial velocities, and a line broadening parameter is listed for a subset of these. Mean {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} spectra are made available to the community. The {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} DR3 catalogue includes about 1 million mean spectra from the radial velocity spectrometer, and about 220 million low-resolution blue and red prism photometer BP/RP mean spectra. The results of the analysis of epoch photometry are provided for some 10 million sources across 24 variability types. {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} DR3 includes astrophysical parameters and source class probabilities for about 470 million and 1500 million sources, respectively, including stars, galaxies, and quasars. Orbital elements and trend parameters are provided for some 800 000 astrometric, spectroscopic and eclipsing binaries. More than 150 000 Solar System objects, including new discoveries, with preliminary orbital solutions and individual epoch observations are part of this release. Reflectance spectra derived from the epoch BP/RP spectral data are published for about 60 000 asteroids. Finally, an additional data set is provided, namely the {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} Andromeda Photometric Survey, consisting of the photometric time series for all sources located in a 5.5 degree radius field centred on the Andromeda galaxy.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Conclusions.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} This data release represents a major advance with respect to {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} DR2 and {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} EDR3 because of the unprecedented quantity, quality, and variety of source astrophysical data. To date this is the largest collection of all-sky spectrophotometry, radial velocities, variables, and astrophysical parameters derived from both low- and high-resolution spectra and includes a spectrophotometric and dynamical survey of SSOs of the highest accuracy. The non-single star content surpasses the existing data by orders of magnitude. The quasar host and galaxy light profile collection is the first such survey that is all sky and space based. The astrophysical information provided in {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} DR3 will unleash the full potential of {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater}’s exquisite astrometric, photometric, and radial velocity surveys.},

	abstract = {Multi-epoch radial velocity measurements of stars can be used to identify stellar, substellar, and planetary-mass companions. Even a small number of observation epochs can be informative about companions, though there can be multiple qualitatively different orbital solutions that fit the data. We have custom-built a Monte Carlo sampler (The Joker) that delivers reliable (and often highly multimodal) posterior samplings for companion orbital parameters given sparse radial velocity data. Here we use The Joker to perform a search for companions to 96,231 red giant stars observed in the APOGEE survey (DR14) with ≥3 spectroscopic epochs. We select stars with probable companions by making a cut on our posterior belief about the amplitude of the variation in stellar radial velocity induced by the orbit. We provide (1) a catalog of 320 companions for which the stellar companion’s properties can be confidently determined, (2) a catalog of 4898 stars that likely have companions, but would require more observations to uniquely determine the orbital properties, and (3) posterior samplings for the full orbital parameters for all stars in the parent sample. We show the characteristics of systems with confidently determined companion properties and highlight interesting systems with candidate compact object companions.},

	abstract = {The Third Catalogue of Nearby Stars (Gliese \& Jahreiss Preliminary Version of the third Catalogue of Nearby Stars, 1991) includes over 1850 stars which lie north of δ 30° and are either identified as spectral type M, or are unclassified but with an absolute visual magnitude estimate MV{\textgreater}+8.O. Although there is no uniformity in selection criteria, and many of the stars lack basic data (radial velocities, spectral types, accurate photometry), the observational properties of these stars underlie most estimates of the fundamental characteristics of the Galactic Disk. We have obtained optical spectroscopy of 1746 of the 1876 stars-the remaining 130 are binary companions of brighter stars and inaccessible to our observations. These spectra allow us, first, to exclude 61 stars as either degenerates or as misclassified earlier-type (B - K) stars lying beyond the 25 pc limit; to establish radial velocities accurate to ±10 km s-1 for all stars confirmed as late-type dwarfs; to determine spectral types and absolute magnitudes from the TiO bandstrength, allowing more accurate distance estimates for stars with inaccurate (or no) trigonometric parallax measurements; and to identify stars with Ha emission (chromospherically active stars) and with strong CaH absorption (perhaps including some metal-poor disk subdwarfs). We have determined the nearby-star luminosity function from complete samples derived by applying both the distance limits defined by Wielen (1974) and by using limits derived from our own analysis. In both cases, we find good agreement with Wielen's results to MV ∼+11, but lower densities at the maximum (MV∼+12). The latter analysis results in a luminosity function, ΦCNS, which closely matches photometric parallax analyses for MV{\textless}+11 and MV{\textgreater}+14 – we do not recover the apparent excess of low-luminosity stars inferred from analysis of the 5 pc sample. However, ΦCNS does lie below Φphot at the peak (MV∼12), and we suggest that this offset is caused by the inclusion of unrecognized binaries in the photometric surveys. We have also reanalyzed the local stellar kinematics using the complete sample and find that the velocity distributions show significant departures from single Gaussian velocity dispersions.},

	abstract = {We have used asteroseismology to determine fundamental properties for 66 Kepler planet-candidate host stars, with typical uncertainties of 3\% and 7\% in radius and mass, respectively. The results include new asteroseismic solutions for four host stars with confirmed planets (Kepler-4, Kepler-14, Kepler-23 and Kepler-25) and increase the total number of Kepler host stars with asteroseismic solutions to 77. A comparison with stellar properties in the planet-candidate catalog by Batalha et al. shows that radii for subgiants and giants obtained from spectroscopic follow-up are systematically too low by up to a factor of 1.5, while the properties for unevolved stars are in good agreement. We furthermore apply asteroseismology to confirm that a large majority of cool main-sequence hosts are indeed dwarfs and not misclassified giants. Using the revised stellar properties, we recalculate the radii for 107 planet candidates in our sample, and comment on candidates for which the radii change from a previously giant-planet/brown-dwarf/stellar regime to a sub-Jupiter size or vice versa. A comparison of stellar densities from asteroseismology with densities derived from transit models in Batalha et al. assuming circular orbits shows significant disagreement for more than half of the sample due to systematics in the modeled impact parameters or due to planet candidates that may be in eccentric orbits. Finally, we investigate tentative correlations between host-star masses and planet-candidate radii, orbital periods, and multiplicity, but caution that these results may be influenced by the small sample size and detection biases.},

	abstract = {We present a study of 33 Kepler planet-candidate host stars for which asteroseismic observations have sufficiently high signal-to-noise ratio to allow extraction of individual pulsation frequencies. We implement a new Bayesian scheme that is flexible in its input to process individual oscillation frequencies, combinations of them, and average asteroseismic parameters, and derive robust fundamental properties for these targets. Applying this scheme to grids of evolutionary models yields stellar properties with median statistical uncertainties of 1.2 per cent (radius), 1.7 per cent (density), 3.3 per cent (mass), 4.4 per cent (distance), and 14 per cent (age), making this the exoplanet host-star sample with the most precise and uniformly determined fundamental parameters to date. We assess the systematics from changes in the solar abundances and mixing-length parameter, showing that they are smaller than the statistical errors. We also determine the stellar properties with three other fitting algorithms and explore the systematics arising from using different evolution and pulsation codes, resulting in 1 per cent in density and radius, and 2 per cent and 7 per cent in mass and age, respectively. We confirm previous findings of the initial helium abundance being a source of systematics comparable to our statistical uncertainties, and discuss future prospects for constraining this parameter by combining asteroseismology and data from space missions. Finally, we compare our derived properties with those obtained using the global average asteroseismic observables along with effective temperature and metallicity, finding excellent level of agreement. Owing to selection effects, our results show that the majority of the high signal-to-noise ratio asteroseismic Kepler host stars are older than the Sun.},

During its 2-year mission, TESS will employ four wide-field optical charge-coupled device cameras to monitor at least 200,000 main-sequence dwarf stars with IC≈4−13 for temporary drops in brightness caused by planetary transits. Each star will be observed for an interval ranging from 1 month to 1 year, depending mainly on the star’s ecliptic latitude. The longest observing intervals will be for stars near the ecliptic poles, which are the optimal locations for follow-up observations with the James Webb Space Telescope. Brightness measurements of preselected target stars will be recorded every 2 min, and full frame images will be recorded every 30 min. TESS stars will be 10 to 100 times brighter than those surveyed by the pioneering Kepler mission. This will make TESS planets easier to characterize with follow-up observations. TESS is expected to find more than a thousand planets smaller than Neptune, including dozens that are comparable in size to the Earth. Public data releases will occur every 4 months, inviting immediate community-wide efforts to study the new planets.

My emphasis is on low-mass stars because they are present from all epochs of star formation in the Galaxy and because they present both special opportunities and problems. The ages of open clusters are important for understanding the limitations of stellar models and for calibrating empirical age indicators. For individual stars, a hierarchy of quality for the available age-dating methods is described. Although our present ability to determine the ages of even the nearest stars is mediocre, the next few years hold great promise as asteroseismology probes beyond stellar surfaces and starts to provide precise interior properties of stars and as models continue to improve when stressed by better observations.},

Photometric metallicities are derived from uvby- Hβ photometry, and the stellar ages from the isochrones of Bergbusch \&amp; VandenBerg as transformed to uvby photometry using the methods of Clem et al.The X (stellar population) criterion of Schuster et al., which combines both kinematic and metallicity information, provides 22 thick-disc stars. σW= 32 ± 5 km s−1, 〈Vrot〉= 154 ± 6 km s−1 and 〈[M/H]〉=−0.55 ± 0.03 dex for these thick-disc stars, which is in agreement with values from previous studies of the thick disc. α-element abundances which are available for some of these thick-disc stars show the typical α-element signatures of the thick disc, supporting the classification procedure based on the X criterion.Both the scatter in metallicity at a given age and the presence of old, metal-rich stars in the age—metallicity relation make it difficult to decide whether or not an age—metallicity relation exists for the older thin-disc stars. For ages greater than 3 Gyr, our results agree with the other recent studies that there is almost no correlation between age and metallicity, Δ([M/Fe])/Δ(age) =−0.01 ± 0.005 dex Gyr−1. For the 22 thick-disc stars there is a range in ages of 7–8 Gyr, but again almost no correlation between age and metallicity.For the subset of main-sequence stars with extra-solar planets, the age—metallicity relation is very similar to that of the total sample, very flat, the main difference being that these stars are mostly metal-rich, [M/H]≳-0.2 dex. However, two of these stars have [M/H]{\textasciitilde}-0.6 dex and have been classified as thick-disc stars. As for the total sample, the range in ages for these stars with extra-solar planetary systems is considerable with a nearly uniform distribution over 3 ≲ age ≲ 13 Gyr.},

The oscillations frequencies are closely related to stellar internal structure properties via the density and the sound speed profiles. Since these properties are in turn tightly linked with the mass and evolutionary state, we can expect to determine the age and mass of a star from the comparison of its oscillation spectrum with the predictions of stellar models. Such a comparison will of course suffer both from the problems we face when modeling a particular star (for instance the uncertainties on its global parameters and chemical composition) and from our general misunderstanding of the physical processes at work in stellar interiors (for instance the various transport processes that may lead to core mixing and affect the ages predicted by models). However for stars where observations have provided very precise and numerous oscillation frequencies together with accurate global parameters and additional information (as the radius or the mass of the star if it is member of a binary system, the radius if it observable in interferometry or the mean density if the star is an exoplanet host), we can also expect to better constrain the physical description of the stellar structure and transport processes and to finally get a more reliable age estimation.},

	abstract = {Estimating stellar ages is important for advancing our understanding of stellar and exoplanet evolution and investigating the history of the Milky Way. However, ages for low-mass stars are hard to infer as they evolve slowly on the main sequence. In addition, empirical dating methods are difficult to calibrate for low-mass stars as they are faint. In this work, we calculate ages for Kepler F, G, and crucially K and M dwarfs, using their rotation and kinematic properties. We apply the simple assumption that the velocity dispersion of stars increases over time and adopt an age–velocity-dispersion relation (AVR) to estimate average stellar ages for groupings of coeval stars. We calculate the vertical velocity dispersion of stars in bins of absolute magnitude, temperature, rotation period, and Rossby number and then convert velocity dispersion to kinematic age via an AVR. Using this method, we estimate gyro-kinematic ages for 29,949 Kepler stars with measured rotation periods. We are able to estimate ages for clusters and asteroseismic stars with an rms of 1.22 Gyr and 0.26 Gyr respectively. With our Astraea machine-learning algorithm, which predicts rotation periods, we suggest a new selection criterion (a weight of 0.15) to increase the size of the McQuillan et al. catalog of Kepler rotation periods by up to 25\%. Using predicted rotation periods, we estimated gyro-kinematic ages for stars without measured rotation periods and found promising results by comparing 12 detailed age–element abundance trends with literature values.},

Among the sample of stars with the highest quality data sets, we recover periods in 66\%; as the length of the data set increases, our recovery rate approaches 100\%.

Whether a star needs this core to generate a solar-like magnetic dynamo is still unclear. Recent studies suggest fully and partially convective stars exhibit very similar period–activity relationships, hinting that dynamos generated by stars with and without radiative cores hold similar properties. Here, using kinematic ages, we discover an abrupt change in the stellar spin-down law across the fully convective boundary. We found that fully convective stars exhibit a higher angular momentum loss rate, corresponding to a torque that is {\textasciitilde}1.51 times higher for a given angular velocity than partially convective stars around the fully convective boundary. Because stellar-wind torques depend primarily on large-scale magnetic fields and mass-loss rates, both of which are suggested to be similar for partially and fully convective stars, the observed abrupt change in spin-down law suggests that the dynamos of partially and fully convective stars may be fundamentally different.},

	abstract = {Abstract The M dwarf stars are exciting targets for exoplanet investigations; however, their fundamental stellar properties are difficult to measure. Perhaps the most challenging property is stellar age. Once on the main sequence, M dwarfs change imperceptibly in their temperature and luminosity, necessitating novel statistical techniques for estimating their ages. In this paper, we infer ages for known eccentric-planet-hosting M dwarfs using a combination of kinematics and α -element enrichment, both shown to correlate with age for Sun-like FGK stars. We calibrate our method on FGK stars in a Bayesian context. To measure α -enrichment, we use publicly available spectra from the CARMENES exoplanet survey and a recently developed [Ti/Fe] calibration utilizing individual Ti i and Fe i absorption lines in the Y band. Tidal effects are expected to circularize the orbits of short-period planets on short timescales; however, we find a number of mildly eccentric, close-in planets orbiting old (∼8 Gyr) stars. For these systems, we use our ages to constrain the tidal dissipation parameter of the planets, Q p . For two mini-Neptune planets, GJ 176 b and GJ 536 b, we find that they have Q p values more similar to the ice giants than to the terrestrial planets in our solar system. For GJ 436 b, we estimate an age of and constrain the Q p to be {\textgreater}10 5 , in good agreement with constraints from its inferred tidal heating. We find that GJ 876 d has likely undergone significant orbital evolution over its lifetime, potentially influenced by its three outer companions that orbit in a Laplace resonance.},

We employ a sample of 163 planets around early- to mid-M dwarfs across 101 systems detected by NASA’s Kepler Mission. We constrain the orbital eccentricity for each planet by leveraging the Kepler lightcurve together with a stellar density prior, constructed using metallicity from spectroscopy, Ks magnitude from 2MASS, and stellar parallax from Gaia. Within a Bayesian hierarchical framework, we extract the underlying eccentricity distribution, assuming alternately Rayleigh, half-Gaussian, and Beta functions for both single- and multi-transit systems. We described the eccentricity distribution for apparently single-transiting planetary systems with a Rayleigh distribution with 𝜎 = 0.19 − 0.03 + 0.04 , and for multitransit systems with 𝜎 = 0.03 − 0.01 + 0.02 . The data suggest the possibility of distinct dynamically warmer and cooler subpopulations within the single-transit distribution: The single-transit data prefer a mixture model composed of two distinct Rayleigh distributions with 𝜎 1 = 0.02 − 0.00 + 0.11 and 𝜎 2 = 0.24 − 0.03 + 0.20 over a single Rayleigh distribution, with 7:1 odds. We contextualize our findings within a planet formation framework, by comparing them to analogous results in the literature for planets orbiting FGK stars. By combining our derived eccentricity distribution with other M dwarf demographic constraints, we estimate the underlying eccentricity distribution for the population of early- to mid-M dwarf planets in the local neighborhood.},

	abstract = {Gyrochronology, the field of age-dating stars using mainly their rotation periods and masses, is ideal for inferring the ages of individual main-sequence stars. However, due to the lack of physical understanding of the complex magnetic fields in stars, gyrochronology relies heavily on empirical calibrations that require consistent and reliable stellar age measurements across a wide range of periods and masses. In this paper, we obtain a sample of consistent ages using the gyro-kinematic age-dating method, a technique to calculate the kinematics ages of stars. Using a Gaussian Process model conditioned on ages from this sample ({\textasciitilde} 1 - 14 Gyr) and known clusters (0.67 - 3.8 Gyr), we calibrate the first empirical gyrochronology relation that is capable of inferring ages for single, main-sequence stars between 0.67 Gyr to 14 Gyr. Cross-validating and testing results suggest our model can infer cluster and asteroseismic ages with an average uncertainty of just over 1 Gyr. With this model, we obtain gyrochronology ages for {\textasciitilde} 100,000 stars within 1.5 kpc of the Sun with period measurements from Kepler and ZTF, and 384 unique planet host stars.},

The KIC is a catalog containing photometric and physical data for sources in the Kepler mission field of view; it is used by the mission to select optimal targets. Four of the visible-light (g, r, i, z) magnitudes used in the KIC are tied to Sloan Digital Sky Survey magnitudes; the fifth (D51) is an AB magnitude calibrated to be consistent with Castelli \& Kurucz (CK) model atmosphere fluxes. We derived atmospheric extinction corrections from hourly observations of secondary standard fields within the Kepler field of view. For these filters and extinction estimates, repeatability of absolute photometry for stars brighter than magnitude 15 is typically 2\%. We estimated stellar parameters \{T eff, log (g), log (Z), E B - V \} using Bayesian posterior probability maximization to match observed colors to CK stellar atmosphere models. We applied Bayesian priors describing the distribution of solar-neighborhood stars in the color-magnitude diagram, in log (Z), and in height above the galactic plane. Several comparisons with samples of stars classified by other means indicate that for 4500 K {\textless}=T eff {\textless}= 6500 K, our classifications are reliable within about ±200 K and 0.4 dex in log (g) for dwarfs, with somewhat larger log (g) uncertainties for giants. It is difficult to assess the reliability of our log (Z) estimates, but there is reason to suspect that it is poor, particularly at extreme T eff. Comparisons between the CK models and observed colors are generally satisfactory with some exceptions, notably for stars cooler than 4500 K. Of great importance for the Kepler mission, for T eff {\textless}= 5400 K, comparison with asteroseismic results shows that the distinction between main-sequence stars and giants is reliable with about 98\% confidence. Larger errors in log (g) occur for warmer stars, for which our filter set provides inadequate gravity diagnostics. The KIC is available through the MAST data archive.},

We are able to constrain the eccentricities of 51 systems with a single transiting planet, which supplement our previous measurements of 66 planets in multi-planet systems. Through a Bayesian hierarchical analysis, we find evidence that systems with only one detected transiting planet have a different eccentricity distribution than systems with multiple detected transiting planets. The eccentricity distribution of the single-transiting systems is well described by the positive half of a zero-mean Gaussian distribution with a dispersion σe = 0.32 ± 0.06, while the multiple-transit systems are consistent with . A mixture model suggests a fraction of of single-transiting systems have a moderate eccentricity, represented by a Rayleigh distribution that peaks at . This finding may reflect differences in the formation pathways of systems with different numbers of transiting planets. We investigate the possibility that eccentricities are self-excited in closely packed planetary systems, as well as the influence of long-period giant companion planets. We find that both mechanisms can qualitatively explain the observations. We do not find any evidence for a correlation between eccentricity and stellar metallicity, as has been seen for giant planets. Neither do we find any evidence that orbital eccentricity is linked to the detection of a companion star.

Such models have been used previously to model the disc of the Milky Way, but here we extend this framework to allow its application to discs of any mass, scalelength, and a wide range of thickness from infinitely thin to near spherical (ellipticities from 0 to 0.9). The models have the advantage of simplicity of implementation, and we expect faster run speeds over a double exponential disc treatment. The potentials are fully analytical, and differentiable at all points. The mass distribution of our models deviates from the radial mass distribution of a pure exponential disc by \&lt;0.4 per cent out to 4 disc scalelengths, and \&lt;1.9 per cent out to 10 disc scalelengths. We tabulate fitting parameters which facilitate construction of exponential discs for any scalelength, and a wide range of disc thickness (a user-friendly, web-based interface is also available). Our recipe is well suited for numerical modelling of the tidal effects of a giant disc galaxy on star clusters or dwarf galaxies. We consider three worked examples; the Milky Way thin and thick disc, and a discy dwarf galaxy.},

	abstract = {It has recently been shown that stellar clustering plays an important role in shaping the properties of planetary systems. We investigate how the multiplicity distributions and orbital periods of planetary systems depend on the 6D phase space density of stars surrounding planet host systems. We find that stars in high stellar phase space density environments (overdensities) have a factor of 1.6–2.0 excess in the number of single-planet systems compared to stars in low stellar phase space density environments (the field). The multiplicity distribution of planets around field stars is much flatter (i.e., there is a greater fraction of multiplanet systems) than in overdensities. This result is primarily driven by the combined facts that (i) “hot Jupiters” (HJs) are almost exclusively found in overdensities and (ii) HJs are predominantly observed to be single-planet systems. Nevertheless, we find that the difference in multiplicity is even more pronounced when only considering planets in the Kepler sample, which contains few HJs. This suggests that the Kepler dichotomy—an apparent excess of systems with a single transiting planet—plausibly arises from environmental perturbations. In overdensities, the orbital periods of single-planet systems are smaller than orbital periods of multiple-planet systems. As this difference is more pronounced in overdensities, the mechanism responsible for this effect may be enhanced by stellar clustering. Taken together, the pronounced dependence of planetary multiplicity and orbital period distributions on stellar clustering provides a potentially powerful tool to diagnose the impact of environment on the formation and evolution of planetary systems.},

	abstract = {agama is a publicly available software library for a broad range of applications in the field of stellar dynamics. It provides methods for computing the gravitational potential of arbitrary analytic density profiles or N-body models, orbit integration and analysis, transformations between position/velocity and action/angle variables, distribution functions expressed in terms of actions and their moments, and iterative construction of self-consistent multicomponent galaxy models. Applications include the inference about the structure of Milky Way or other galaxies from observations of stellar kinematics, preparation of equilibrium initial conditions for N-body simulations, and analysis of snapshots from simulations. The library is written in C++ , provides a python interface, and can be coupled to other stellar-dynamical software: amuse, galpy, and nemo. It is hosted at http://github.com/GalacticDynamics-Oxford/Agama.},

	abstract = {The ages of solar-like stars have been at the center of many studies such as exoplanet characterization or Galactic-archeology. While ages are usually computed from stellar evolution models, relations linking ages to other stellar properties, such as rotation and magnetic activity, have been investigated. With the large catalog of 55,232 rotation periods, P rot, and photometric magnetic activity index, S ph from Kepler data, we have the opportunity to look for such magneto-gyro-chronology relations. Stellar ages are obtained with two stellar evolution codes that include treatment of angular momentum evolution, hence using P rot as input in addition to classical atmospheric parameters. We explore two different ways of predicting stellar ages on three subsamples with spectroscopic observations: solar analogs, late-F and G dwarfs, and K dwarfs. We first perform a Bayesian analysis to derive relations between S ph and ages between 1 and 5 Gyr, and other stellar properties. For late-F and G dwarfs, and K dwarfs, the multivariate regression favors the model with P rot and S ph with median differences of 0.1\% and 0.2\%, respectively. We also apply Machine Learning techniques with a Random Forest algorithm to predict ages up to 14 Gyr with the same set of input parameters. For late-F, G and K dwarfs together, predicted ages are on average within 5.3\% of the model ages and improve to 3.1\% when including P rot. These are very promising results for a quick age estimation for solar-like stars with photometric observations, especially with current and future space missions.},

	abstract = {Most stars form in star clusters and stellar associations. However, only about ∼1 per cent of the presently known exoplanets are found in these environments. To understand the roles of star cluster environments in shaping the dynamical evolution of planetary systems, we carry out direct N-body simulations of four planetary system models in three different star cluster environments with respectively N = 2k, 8k and 32k stars. In each cluster, an ensemble of initially identical planetary systems are assigned to solar-type stars with ∼1 M⊙ and evolved for 50 Myr. We found that following the depletion of protoplanetary discs, external perturbations and planet–planet interactions are two driving mechanisms responsible for the destabilization of planetary systems. The planet survival rate varies from ∼95 per cent in the N = 2k cluster to ∼60 per cent in the N = 32k cluster, which suggests that most planetary systems can indeed survive in low-mass clusters, except in the central regions. We also find that planet ejections through stellar encounters are cumulative processes, as only ∼3 per cent of encounters are strong enough to excite the eccentricity by Δe ≥ 0.5. Short-period planets can be perturbed through orbit crossings with long-period planets. When taking into account planet–planet interactions, the planet ejection rate nearly doubles, and therefore multiplicity contributes to the vulnerability of planetary systems. In each ensemble, ∼0.2 per cent of planetary orbits become retrograde due to random directions of stellar encounters. Our results predict that young low-mass star clusters are promising sites for next-generation planet surveys, yet low planet detection rates are expected in dense globular clusters such as 47 Tuc. Nevertheless, planets in denser stellar environments are likely to have shorter orbital periods, which enhance their detectability.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this investigation is to provide a representative sample of the motions of the stars in the neighborhood of the sun. The three components of the velocities of 444 stars within 20 parsecs from the sun have therefore been computed from their proper motions, radial velocities, and parallaxes. The constants for the velocity ellipsoids were determined for all the spectral types involved and are referred to the system of galactic co-ordinates. The velocities of the stars were then projected on the "dynamical axes" of the galaxy, the xi-axis being directed toward galactic longitude 339°, the y1-axis toward galactic longitude 69°, and the z1-axis toward the galactic pole. The x1-axis points approximately toward the center of the galaxy; the yi-axis is the axis of asymmetry in stellar motions. This asymmetry is very evident among the stars studied. Attempts were made to establish correlations between the motions of the stars and their masses, the bolometric magnitude Mb beiiig used as a measure of the masses of the stars. For all the velocity com- ponents studied a definite correlation was established, although the variation with mass is not very pro- nounced. The z1-components, referred to the galactic plane and taken without regard to sign, show a higher speed for the less massive stars than for the more massive. Both the si-components and the y1-compcrnents yield definite values for which the mass is a maximum. These values are Xi = +5 and = -9 km/sec, both referred to the sun. Values of v2 = (x1 + 17)2 + (yi + 300)2 + (z{\textasciitilde} + 7)2 were computed and were assumed to represent the velocity of a star relative to the center of the galaxy in a nonrotating system of co-ordinates. These values show a maximum mass for a root-mean-square value of v equal to 295 km/sec. All these effects can be understood on the hypothesis that the more massive a star, the greater is the probability that it moves in an exact circle around the center of the galaxy and that its orbit lies in the galactic plane. The observed relationship between stellar motions and stellar masses has been interpreted as the effect of internal friction in a prestellar system of gas or dust, in accordance with theories previously advanced},

	abstract = {A simple question of celestial mechanics is investigated : in what regions of phase space near a binary system can planets persist for long times ? The planets are taken to be test particles moving in the Ðeld of an eccentric binary system. A range of values of the binary eccentricity and mass ratio is studied, and both the case of planets orbiting close to one of the stars, and that of planets outside the binary orbiting the systemÏs center of mass, are examined. From the results, empirical expressions are developed for both (1) the largest orbit around each of the stars and (2) the smallest orbit around the binary system as a whole, in which test particles survive the length of the integration (104 binary periods). The empirical expressions developed, which are roughly linear in both the mass ratio k and the binary eccentricity e, are determined for the range 0.0 ¹ e ¹ 0.7È0.8 and 0.1 ¹ k ¹ 0.9 in both regions and can be used to guide searches for planets in binary systems. After considering the case of a single low-mass planet in binary systems, the stability of a mutually interacting system of planets orbiting one star of a binary system is examined, though in less detail.},

	abstract = {Methods. We have used the frequency map analysis (FMA) to measure the diﬀusion of orbits in the phase space as an indicator of chaotic behaviour. Results. First we revisited the reliability of the empirical formula computing ac in the case of single planets in binaries and we ﬁnd that, in some cases, it underestimates by 10–20\% the real outer limit of stability and it does not account for planets trapped in resonance with the companion star well beyond ac. For two-planet systems, the value of ∆ is close to that computed for planets around single stars, but the level of chaoticity close to it substantially increases for smaller semimajor axes and higher eccentricities of the binary orbit. In these conﬁgurations ac also begins to be unreliable and non-linear secular resonances with the stellar companion lead to chaotic behaviour well within ac, even for single planet systems. For two planet systems, the superposition of mean motion resonances, either mutual or with the binary companion, and non-linear secular resonances may lead to chaotic behaviour in all cases. We have developed a parametric semi-empirical formula determining the minimum value of the binary semimajor axis, for a given eccentricity of the binary orbit, below which stable two planet systems cannot exist. Conclusions. The superposition of diﬀerent resonances between two or more planets and the binary companion may prevent the existence of stable dynamical conﬁgurations in binaries. As a consequence, care must be devoted when applying the Holman and Wiegert criterion and the Hill stability against mutual close encounters for a multiplanet system in binaries.},

	abstract = {The past decade has seen a revolution in our understanding of protoplanetary disk evolution and planet formation in single-star systems. However, the majority of solar-type stars form in binary systems, so the impact of binary companions on protoplanetary disks is an important element in our understanding of planet formation. We have compiled a combined multiplicity/disk census of Taurus–Auriga, plus a restricted sample of close binaries in other regions, in order to explore the role of multiplicity in disk evolution. Our results imply that the tidal inﬂuence of a close ( 40 AU) binary companion signiﬁcantly hastens the process of protoplanetary disk dispersal, as ∼2/3 of all close binaries promptly disperse their disks within 1 Myr after formation. However, prompt disk dispersal only occurs for a small fraction of wide binaries and single stars, with ∼80\%–90\% retaining their disks for at least ∼2–3 Myr (but rarely for more than ∼5 Myr). Our new constraints on the disk clearing timescale have signiﬁcant implications for giant planet formation; most single stars have 3–5 Myr within which to form giant planets, whereas most close binary systems would have to form giant planets within 1 Myr. If core accretion is the primary mode for giant planet formation, then gas giants in close binaries should be rare. Conversely, since almost all single stars have a similar period of time within which to form gas giants, their relative rarity in radial velocity (RV) surveys indicates either that the giant planet formation timescale is very well matched to the disk dispersal timescale or that features beyond the disk lifetime set the likelihood of giant planet formation.},

	abstract = {Observations of extrasolar planets reveal that planets can be found in close binary systems, where the semimajor axis of the binary orbit is less than 20 au. The existence of these planets challenges planet formation theory because the strong gravitational perturbations due to the companion increase encounter velocities between planetesimals and make it difﬁcult for them to grow through accreting collisions. We study planetesimal encounter velocities in binary systems, where the planetesimals are embedded in a circumprimary gas disc that is allowed to evolve under the inﬂuence of the gravitational perturbations of the companion star. We use the RODEO (Roe Solver for Disc Embedded Objects) method to evolve the vertically integrated Navier–Stokes equations for the gas disc. Embedded within this disc is a population of planetesimals of various sizes that evolve under the inﬂuence of the gravitational forces of both stars and friction with the gas. The equations of motion for the planetesimals are integrated using a fourth-order symplectic algorithm. We ﬁnd that the encounter velocities between planetesimals of different size strongly depend on the gas disc eccentricity. Depending on the amount of wave damping, we ﬁnd two possible states of the gas disc: a quiet state, where the disc eccentricity reaches a steady state that is determined by the forcing of the binary, for which the encounter velocities do not differ by more than a factor of 2 from the case of a circular gas disc, and an excited state, for which the gas disc obtains a large free eccentricity, which drives up the encounter velocities more substantially. In both cases, the inclusion of the full gas dynamics increases the encounter velocity compared to the case of a static, circular gas disc. Full numerical parameter exploration is still impossible, but we derive analytical formulae to estimate encounter velocities between bodies of different sizes given the gas disc eccentricity. The gas dynamical evolution of a protoplanetary disc in a binary system tends to make planetesimal accretion even more difﬁcult than in a static, axisymmetric gas disc.},

We combine our radial velocity ﬁts with Keck NIRC2 adaptive optics (AO) imaging data to place constraints on the allowed masses and orbital periods of the companions responsible for the detected accelerations. The estimated masses of the companions range between 1–500 MJup, with orbital semi-major axes typically between 1–75 AU. A signiﬁcant majority of the companions detected by our survey are constrained to have minimum masses comparable to or larger than those of the transiting planets in these systems, making them candidates for inﬂuencing the orbital evolution of the inner gas giant. We estimate a total occurrence rate of 51\% ± 10\% for companions with masses between 1–13 MJup and orbital semi-major axes between 1–20 AU in our sample. We ﬁnd no statistically signiﬁcant difference between the frequency of companions to transiting planets with misaligned or eccentric orbits and those with well-aligned, circular orbits.

	abstract = {Multi-star systems are common, yet little is known about a stellar companion’s inﬂuence on the formation and evolution of planetary systems. For instance, stellar companions may have facilitated the inward migration of hot Jupiters toward to their present day positions. Many observed short-period gas giant planets also have orbits that are misaligned with respect to their star’s spin axis, which has also been attributed to the presence of a massive outer companion on a non-coplanar orbit. We present the results of a multi-band direct imaging survey using Keck NIRC2 to measure the fraction of short-period gas giant planets found in multi-star systems. Over three years, we completed a survey of 50 targets (“Friends of Hot Jupiters”) with 27 targets showing some signature of multi-body interaction (misaligned or eccentric orbits) and 23 targets in a control sample (well-aligned and circular orbits). We report the masses, projected separations, and conﬁrmed common proper motion for the 19 stellar companions found around 17 stars. Correcting for survey incompleteness, we report companion fractions of 48\% ± 9\%, 47\% ± 12\%, and 51\% ± 13\% in our total, misaligned/eccentric, and control samples, respectively. This total stellar companion fraction is 2.8σ larger than the fraction of ﬁeld stars with companions approximately 50–2000 AU. We observe no correlation between misaligned/eccentric hot Jupiter systems and the incidence of stellar companions. Combining this result with our previous radial velocity survey, we determine that 72\% ± 16\% of hot Jupiters are part of multi-planet and/or multi-star systems.},

The Friends of Hot Jupiters project uses three complementary techniques to search for stellar companions to known planet-hosting stars: radial velocity monitoring, adaptive optics imaging, and near-infrared spectroscopy. In this paper, we examine high-resolution K band infrared spectra of ﬁfty stars hosting gas giant planets on short-period orbits. We use spectral ﬁtting to search for blended lines due to the presence of cool stellar companions in the spectra of our target stars, where we are sensitive to companions with temperatures between 3500 and 5000 K and projected separations less than 100 AU in most systems. We identify eight systems with candidate low-mass companions, including one companion that was independently detected in our AO imaging survey. For systems with radial velocity accelerations, a spectroscopic non-detection rules out scenarios involving a stellar companion in a high inclination orbit. We use these data to place an upper limit on the stellar binary fraction at small projected separations, and show that the observed population of candidate companions is consistent with that of ﬁeld stars and also with the population of wide-separation companions detected in our previous AO survey. We ﬁnd no evidence that spectroscopic stellar companions are preferentially located in systems with short-period gas giant planets on eccentric and/or misaligned orbits.},

We identify a subset of 850 stars that have Doppler observations sufficient to detect uniformly all planets with radial velocity semiamplitudes K ¿ 30 m s-1 and orbital periods shorter than 4 yr. From this subset of stars, we determine that fewer than 3\% of stars with -0.5 ¡ [Fe/H] ¡ 0.0 have Doppler-detected planets. Above solar metallicity, there is a smooth and rapid rise in the fraction of stars with planets. At [Fe/H] ¿ +0.3 dex, 25\% of observed stars have detected gas giant planets. A power-law fit to these data relates the formation probability for gas giant planets to the square of the number of metal atoms. High stellar metallicity also appears to be correlated with the presence of multiple-planet systems and with the total detected planet mass. This data set was examined to better understand the origin of high metallicity in stars with planets. None of the expected fossil signatures of accretion are observed in stars with planets relative to the general sample: (1) metallicity does not appear to increase as the mass of the convective envelopes decreases, (2) subgiants with planets do not show dilution of metallicity, (3) no abundance variations for Na, Si, Ti, or Ni are found as a function of condensation temperature, and (4) no correlations between metallicity and orbital period or eccentricity could be identified. We conclude that stars with extrasolar planets do not have an accretion signature that distinguishes them from other stars; more likely, they are simply born in higher metallicity molecular clouds.},

	abstract = {We present a method to characterize statistically the parameters of a detached binary sample—binary fraction, separation distribution, and mass-ratio distribution—using noisy radial velocity data with as few as two, randomly spaced, epochs per object. To do this, we analyze the distribution of ΔRVmax, the maximum radial velocity difference between any two epochs for the same object. At low values, the core of this distribution is dominated by measurement errors, but for large enough samples there is a high-velocity tail that can effectively constrain the parameters of the binary population. We discuss our approach for the case of a population of detached white dwarf (WD) binaries with separations that are decaying via gravitational wave emission. We derive analytic expressions for the present-day distribution of separations, integrated over the star formation history of the Galaxy, for parameterized initial WD separation distributions at the end of the common-envelope phase. We use Monte Carlo techniques to produce grids of simulated ΔRVmax distributions with specific binary population parameters, and the same sampling cadences and radial velocity errors as the observations, and we compare them to the real ΔRVmax distribution to constrain the properties of the binary population. We illustrate the sensitivity of the method to both the model and observational parameters. In the particular case of binary WDs, every model population predicts a merger rate per star which can easily be compared to specific Type Ia supernova rates. In a companion paper, we apply the method to a sample of ∼4000 WDs from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The binary fractions and separation distribution parameters allowed by the data indicate a rate of WD–WD mergers per unit stellar mass in the Galactic disk, ∼1 × 10−13 mergers yr−1 M−1☉, remarkably similar to the rate per unit mass of Type Ia supernovae in Milky Way like galaxies.},

	abstract = {We describe a search for close spectroscopic dwarf M star binaries using data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey to address the question of the rate of occurrence of multiplicity in M dwarfs. We use a template-fitting technique to measure radial velocities from 145,888 individual spectra obtained for a magnitude-limited sample of 39,543 M dwarfs. Typically, the three or four spectra observed for each star are separated in time by less than four hours, but for ∼17\% of the stars, the individual observations span more than two days. In these cases we are sensitive to large-amplitude radial velocity variations on timescales comparable to the separation between the observations. We use a control sample of objects having observations taken within a four-hour period to make an empirical estimate of the underlying radial velocity error distribution and simulate our detection efficiency for a wide range of binary star systems. We find the frequency of binaries among the dwarf M stars with a ¡ 0.4 AU to be 3\%–4\%. Comparison with other samples of binary stars demonstrates that the close binary fraction, like the total binary fraction, is an increasing function of primary mass.},

Using light curve data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite mission and follow up high-resolution Doppler spectroscopic observations, we ﬁnd the BD has a radius of ���� = 1.08 ± 0.03RJ, a mass of ���� = 64.4 ± 2.3MJ, an orbital period of �� = 7.200865 ± 0.00002 days, and an eccentricity of �� = 0.337 ± 0.002.

TOI-2119b joins an emerging population of transiting BDs around M-dwarf host stars, with TOI-2119 being the ninth such system. These M-dwarf–brown dwarf systems occupy mass ratios near �� = ����/��★ ≈ 0.1, which separates them from the typical mass ratios for systems with transiting substellar objects and giant exoplanets that orbit more massive stars. TOI-2119 is also one of the most active M-dwarf stars known to host a transiting brown dwarf. The nature of the secondary eclipse of the BD by the star enables us to estimate the eﬀective temperature of the substellar object to be 2030 ± 84K, which is consistent with predictions by substellar evolutionary models.},

	abstract = {The census of exoplanets is incomplete for orbital distances larger than 1 AU. Here, we present 41long-period planet candidates in 38systems identiﬁed by Planet Hunters based on Kepler archival data (Q0–Q17). Among them, 17exhibit only one transit, 14have two visible transits, and 10have more than three visible transits. For planet candidates with only one visible transit, we estimate their orbital periods based on transit duration and host star properties. The majority of the planet candidates in this work (75\%) have orbital periods that correspond to distances of 1–3 AU from their host stars. We conduct follow-up imaging and spectroscopic observations to validate and characterize planet host stars. In total, we obtain adaptive optics images for 33stars to search for possible blending sources. Six stars have stellar companions within 4″. We obtain high-resolution spectra for 6stars to determine their physical properties. Stellar properties for other stars are obtained from the NASA Exoplanet Archive and the Kepler Stellar Catalog by Huber et al. We validate 7 planet candidates that have planet conﬁdence over 0.997 (3σ level). These validated planets include 3 single-transit planets (KIC-3558849b, KIC5951458b, and KIC-8540376c), 3 planets with double transits (KIC-8540376b, KIC-9663113b, and KIC10525077b), and 1 planet with four transits (KIC-5437945b). This work provides assessment regarding the existence of planets at wide separations and the associated false positive rate for transiting observation (17\%–33\%). More than half of the long-period planets with at least three transits in this paper exhibit transit timing variations up to 41 hr, which suggest additional components that dynamically interact with the transiting planet candidates. The nature of these components can be determined by follow-up radial velocity and transit observations.},

	abstract = {The Kepler mission has discovered thousands of exoplanets and revolutionized our understanding of their population. This large, homogeneous catalog of discoveries has enabled rigorous studies of the occurrence rate of exoplanets and planetary systems as a function of their physical properties. However, transit surveys such as Kepler are most sensitive to planets with orbital periods much shorter than the orbital periods of Jupiter and Saturn, the most massive planets in our solar system. To address this deﬁciency, we perform a fully automated search for long-period exoplanets with only one or two transits in the archival Kepler light curves. When applied to the ∼40,000 brightest Sun-like target stars, this search produces 16 long-period exoplanet candidates. Of these candidates, six are novel discoveries and ﬁve are in systems with inner short-period transiting planets. Since our method involves no human intervention, we empirically characterize the detection efﬁciency of our search. Based on these results, we measure the average occurrence rate of exoplanets smaller than Jupiter with orbital periods in the range 2–25years to be 2.0±0.7 planets per Sun-like star.},

While misaligned CBPs are more difﬁcult to detect, observations of polar-aligned circumbinary gas and debris disks around eccentric binaries suggest that polar planet formation may be possible. A polar-aligned planet has a stable orbit that is inclined by 90° to the orbital plane of the binary with an angular momentum vector that is aligned to the binary eccentricity vector. With n-body simulations we model polar terrestrial planet formation using hydrodynamic gas disk simulations to motivate the initial particle distribution. Terrestrial planet formation around an eccentric binary is more likely in a polar alignment than in a coplanar alignment. Similar planetary systems form in a polar alignment around an eccentric binary and a coplanar alignment around a circular binary. The polar planetary systems are stable even with the effects of general relativity. Planetary orbits around an eccentric binary exhibit tilt and eccentricity oscillations at all inclinations; however, the oscillations are larger in the coplanar case than the polar case. We suggest that polar-aligned terrestrial planets will be found in the future.},

	abstract = {We use three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations to show that an initially mildly misaligned circumbinary accretion disk around an eccentric binary can evolve to an orientation that is perpendicular to the orbital plane of the binary (polar alignment). As the disk evolves to the perpendicular state, it undergoes nodal libration oscillations of the tilt angle and the longitude of the ascending node. Dissipation within the disk causes the oscillations to damp. The process operates above a critical initial misalignment angle that depends upon the eccentricity of the binary and the mass of the disk. For binary eccentricity of 0.5, the process operates typically for disk masses smaller than a few percent of the binary mass and initial tilt angle of more than 40°. This evolution has important implications for planet formation around eccentric binary star systems.},

	abstract = {Circumbinary gas disks are often observed to be misaligned with the binary orbit, suggesting that planet formation may proceed in a misaligned disk. With n-body simulations, we consider the formation of circumbinary terrestrial planets from a particle disk that is initially misaligned. We ﬁnd that if terrestrial planets form in this way, in the absence of gas, they can only form close to coplanar or close to polar to the binary orbit. Planets around a circular binary form coplanar while planets around an eccentric binary can form coplanar or polar depending on the initial disk misalignment and the binary eccentricity. The more massive a terrestrial planet is, the more aligned it is (to coplanar or polar) because it has undergone more mergers that lead on average to smaller misalignment angles. Nodal precession of particle disks with very large initial inclinations lead to high mutual inclinations between the particles. This produces high relative velocities between particles that lead to mass ejections that can completely inhibit planet formation. Misaligned terrestrial circumbinary planets may be able to form in the presence of a misaligned circumbinary gas disk that may help to nodally align the particle orbits and maintain the inclination of the planets during their formation.},

This system was previously known to host two transiting planets: one with a period of 3 days (R = 2.4R⊕; Kepler-411b) and one with a period of 7.8 days (R = 4.4R⊕; Kepler-411c), as well as a transiting planetary candidate with a 58-day period (R = 3.3R⊕; KOI 1781.03) from Kepler photometry. Here, we combine Kepler photometry data and new transit timing variation (TTV) measurements from all the Kepler quarters with previous adaptiveoptics imaging results, and dynamical simulations, in order to constrain the properties of the Kepler-411 system. From our analysis, we obtain masses of 25.6±2.6M⊕ for Kepler-411b and 26.4±5.9 M⊕ for Kepler-411c, and we conﬁrm the planetary nature of KOI 1781.03 with a mass of 15.2±5.1M⊕, hence the name Kepler-411d. Furthermore, by assuming near-coplanarity of the system (mutual inclination below 30◦), we discover a nontransiting planet, Kepler-411e, with a mass of 10.8±1.1M⊕ on a 31.5-day orbit, which has a strong dynamical interaction with Kepler-411d. With densities of 1.71 ± 0.39 g cm−3 and 2.32 ± 0.83 g cm−3, both Kepler-411c and Kepler-411d belong to the group of planets with a massive core and a signiﬁcant fraction of volatiles. Although Kepler-411b has a sub-Neptune size, it belongs to the group of rocky planets.},

We present a study aimed at testing the role of stellar multiplicity in the formation and/or evolution of the most massive, closein planetary and substellar companions. Using past and new direct imaging observations, as well as the Gaia DR2 catalogue, we searched for wide binary companions to 38 stars hosting massive giant planets or brown dwarfs (M {\textgreater} 7 MJup) on orbits shorter than ∼1 au. We report the discovery of a new component in the WASP-14 system, and present an independent conﬁrmation of a comoving companion to WASP-18. From a robust Bayesian statistical analysis, we derived a binary fraction of 79.0+−1134..27 per cent between 20 and 10 000 au for our sample, twice as high as for ﬁeld stars with a 3σ signiﬁcance. This binary frequency was found to be larger than for lower-mass planets on similar orbits, and we observed a marginally higher binary rate for inner companions with periods shorter than 10 d. These results demonstrate that stellar companions greatly inﬂuence the formation and/or evolution of these systems, suggesting that the role played by binary companions becomes more important for highermass planets, and that this trend may be enhanced for systems with tighter orbits. Our analysis also revealed a peak in binary separation at 250 au, highlighting a shortfall of close binaries among our sample. This indicates that the mechanisms affecting planet and brown dwarf formation or evolution in binaries must operate from wide separations, although we found that the Kozai–Lidov mechanism is unlikely to be the dominant underlying process. We conclude that binarity plays a crucial role in the existence of very massive short-period giant planets and brown dwarf desert inhabitants, which are almost exclusively observed in multiple systems.},

To overcome the obstacles, we conduct a statistical study that focuses on S-type (circumstellar) planetary systems detected by the radial-velocity (RV) method. We try to account for observational biases by estimating, from available RV data, planet detection efﬁciencies for each individual system. Our main results are as follows. (1) Single (resp. multiple) planetary systems are mostly found in close (wide) binaries with separation aB {\textless} ({\textgreater}) ∼ 100–300 au. (2) In binaries, single and multiple-planet systems are similar in 1D distributions of mass and period as well as eccentricity (in contrast to the “eccentricity dichotomy” found in single star systems) but different in the 2D period-mass diagram. Speciﬁcally, there is a rectangular-shaped gap in the period-mass diagram of single-planet systems but not for multiples. This gap also depends on binary separation and is more prominent in close binaries. (3) There is a rising upper envelope in the period-mass diagram for planets in wide binaries as well as in single stars but not in close binaries. More speciﬁcally, there is a population of massive shortperiod planets in close binaries but almost absent in wide binaries or single stars. We suggest that enhanced planetary migration, collision and/or ejection in close binaries could be the potential underlying explanation for these three features.},

We combined these observations with those from Paper I to search for evidence of the impact binary stars have on planetary systems. Removing the one-quarter of the targets observed identiﬁed as false-positive planet detections, we ﬁnd that transiting planets are suppressed by nearly a factor of seven in close solar-type binaries, nearly twice the suppression previously reported. The result on planet occurrence rates that are based on magnitude-limited surveys is an overestimation by a factor of two if binary suppression is not taken into account. We also ﬁnd tentative evidence for similar close binary suppression of planets in M-dwarf systems. Last, we ﬁnd that the high rates of widely separated companions to hot Jupiter hosts previously reported was likely a result of false-positive contamination in our sample.},

	abstract = {Almost half of the stellar systems in the solar neighborhood are made up of multiple stars. In multiple-star systems, planet formation is under the dynamical inﬂuence of stellar companions, and the planet occurrence rate is expected to be different from that of single stars. There have been numerous studies on the planet occurrence rate of single star systems. However, to fully understand planet formation, the planet occurrence rate in multiple-star systems needs to be addressed. In this work, we infer the planet occurrence rate in multiple-star systems by measuring the stellar multiplicity rate for planet host stars. For a subsample of 56 Kepler planet host stars, we use adaptive optics (AO) imaging and the radial velocity (RV) technique to search for stellar companions. The combination of these two techniques results in high search completeness for stellar companions. We detect 59 visual stellar companions to 25 planet host stars with AO data. Three stellar companions are within 2 and 27 within 6 . We also detect two possible stellar companions (KOI 5 and KOI 69) showing long-term RV acceleration. After correcting for a bias against planet detection in multiple-star systems due to ﬂux contamination, we ﬁnd that planet formation is suppressed in multiple-star systems with separations smaller than 1500 AU. Speciﬁcally, we ﬁnd that compared to single star systems, planets in multiple-star systems occur 4.5 ± 3.2, 2.6 ± 1.0, and 1.7 ± 0.5 times less frequently when a stellar companion is present at a distance of 10, 100, and 1000 AU, respectively. This conclusion applies only to circumstellar planets; the planet occurrence rate for circumbinary planets requires further investigation.},

	abstract = {Wide-ﬁeld surveys for transiting planets, such as the NASA Kepler and TESS missions, are usually conducted without knowing which stars have binary companions. Unresolved and unrecognized binaries give rise to systematic errors in planet occurrence rates, including misclassiﬁed planets and mistakes in completeness corrections. The individual errors can have different signs, making it difﬁcult to anticipate the net effect on inferred occurrence rates. Here, we use simpliﬁed models of signal-to-noise limited transit surveys to try and clarify the situation. We derive a formula for the apparent occurrence rate density measured by an observer who falsely assumes all stars are single. The formula depends on the binary fraction, the mass function of the secondary stars, and the true occurrence of planets around primaries, secondaries, and single stars. It also takes into account the Malmquist bias by which binaries are over-represented in ﬂux-limited samples. Application of the formula to an idealized Kepler-like survey shows that for planets larger than 2 R⊕, the net systematic error is of order 5\%. In particular, unrecognized binaries are unlikely to be the reason for the apparent discrepancies between hot-Jupiter occurrence rates measured in different surveys. For smaller planets the errors are potentially larger: the occurrence of Earth-sized planets could be overestimated by as much as 50\%. We also show that whenever high-resolution imaging reveals a transit host star to be a binary, the planet is usually more likely to orbit the primary star than the secondary star.},

Gaia Early Data Release 3 (Gaia EDR3) contains results for 1.812 billion sources in the magnitude range G = 3–21 based on observations collected by the European Space Agency Gaia satellite during the ﬁrst 34 months of its operational phase. Aims. We describe the input data, the models, and the processing used for the astrometric content of Gaia EDR3, as well as the validation of these results performed within the astrometry task. Methods. The processing broadly followed the same procedures as for Gaia DR2, but with signiﬁcant improvements to the modelling of observations. For the ﬁrst time in the Gaia data processing, colour-dependent calibrations of the line- and point-spread functions have been used for sources with well-determined colours from DR2. In the astrometric processing these sources obtained ﬁve-parameter solutions, whereas other sources were processed using a special calibration that allowed a pseudocolour to be estimated as the sixth astrometric parameter. Compared with DR2, the astrometric calibration models have been extended, and the spin-related distortion model includes a self-consistent determination of basic-angle variations, improving the global parallax zero point.},

	abstract = {Close binaries suppress the formation of circumstellar (S-type) planets and therefore significantly bias the inferred planet occurrence rates and statistical trends. After compiling various radial velocity and high-resolution imaging surveys, we determine that binaries with a \&lt; 1 au fully suppress S-type planets, binaries with a = 10 au host close planets at 15\$\_\{-12\}ˆ\{+17\}\$ per cent the occurrence rate of single stars, and wide binaries with a \&gt; 200 au have a negligible effect on close planet formation. We show that F = 43 ± 7 per cent of solar-type primaries in magnitude-limited samples do not host close planets due to suppression by close stellar companions. By removing spectroscopic binaries from their samples, radial velocity surveys for giant planets boost their detection rates by a factor of 1/(1-F) = 1.8 ± 0.2 compared to transiting surveys. This selection bias fully accounts for the discrepancy in hot Jupiter and close Neptune occurrence rates inferred from these two detection methods. Correcting for both planet suppression by close binaries and transit dilution by wide binaries, the occurrence rate of small planets orbiting single G-dwarfs is 2.1 ± 0.3 times larger than the rate inferred from all G-dwarfs in the Kepler survey. Additionally, about half (but not all) of the observed increase in small, short-period planets towards low-mass hosts can be explained by the corresponding decrease in the binary fraction.},
